INTRODUCTION: Hydroponics is basically a contemporary method of horticulture or basically growing plants using farm produce, and the thing is without using soil. The method of hydroponics is nearly easy but it takes time to understand the method. In the method, crops are planted and grown on water. These crops are also found to be very efficient and filled with benefiting nutrients. According to the scientist’s plants in hydroponics method have direct connection to the roots in form of ‘aqueous solvent’ instead of the soil. Universally, Hydroponics is walking ahead but India encompasses a part of catching up to do. The reason behind this far reaching is profoundly useful in today’s state of the world, where it may play a crucial part in being the back bone of the environment. The worldwide flexibility is the large number of benefits. For occasion, the strategy requires less work, and the yields are much higher as plants develop quicker as compared with the regular ranches. Hydroponics employments comparatively less water that's 20% of the water utilized within the ordinary editing strategies. There's indeed a huge number of benefits for the agriculturists who can develop crops out of the season with their claim imaginative combinations, and give more prominent nourishment and nourishment choice to the clients.

It is much higher than any normal traditional method of farming. The initial cost of setting up is only huge. Also, the other major equipments required are sensors, controllers, and pumps, lightning so as to take care of the crops and handle them. The correct percentage of temperature then the purified water and other important nutrients such as nitrate, phosphorus, potassium etc which helps in development of the plant nutrition because there will be no soil. The system also helps towards water efficiency. Hydroponics farming uses less than 10% of the volume of water that is used in traditional method of farming, and the water left out by the plants is even recycled. The process of growing crops is very interesting: the roots of the plants are put in an absorbent inert medium, like in coconut husk, as a substitute of soil. Coco peat is basically used as a seed base instead of soil. Completely pesticide free, hydroponic farming is miles ahead of organic farming, as it nullifies the effects of harmful chemicals that might be present in the soil. Thus, consumers get the healthiest produce possible. LITERATURE REVIEW: Hydroponic farming is a type of agriculture that involves growing plants without soil, using nutrient-rich water solutions instead. The practice has gained popularity in recent years due to its potential for higher crop yields, more efficient use of resources, and year-round crop production.

CHALLENGES FACED: Hydroponic farming can offer many benefits such as increased crop yield, faster growth rates, and reduced water usage. However, there are also some challenges that hydroponic farmers may face. Here are a few examples: ● Maintaining nutrient levels: Plants grown in hydroponic systems rely entirely on the nutrients provided in the water. It can be challenging to ensure that the correct nutrient levels are maintained throughout the growing cycle, as the plants' needs can change over time. ● Disease and pest control: Because hydroponic systems provide a controlled and often ideal environment for plant growth, they can also attract pests and diseases. It can be challenging to manage these issues without the use of harmful chemicals that could contaminate the water and harm the plants.

Power outages can cause significant problems for hydroponic farmers, as they can disrupt the delicate balance of the system and damage crops. ● Cost of setup: Hydroponic systems can be expensive to set up and require a significant initial investment. This can make it difficult for new farmers to get started, particularly if they are operating on a limited budget. ● Water quality: Hydroponic systems require clean, filtered water to prevent contamination and ensure optimal plant growth. Water quality can vary widely depending on the source, and it can be challenging to maintain consistent water quality over time. Overall, while hydroponic farming offers many benefits, it also comes with some challenges that must be carefully managed to ensure success. SCOPE OF THE STUDY: India's population is growing indiscriminately and this is one of the main reasons for the decreasing availability of agricultural land. As arable land is constantly shrinking, it is difficult to produce staple crops for a rapidly growing population. The hydroponic method will solve the problem of agricultural land in India in the future. More varieties of basic plants can be grown, and the consumption of soil and water is reduced or simply unnecessary. What it would look like when grain is grown in the visible light spectrum and fresh food is available to everyone in the countryside. This could be the start of a new green revolution; witnessed by the millennials here. Another major benefit of the development of hydroponic agriculture in India is the easing of the burden on the poor and the environment in which we breathe and survive. How does that happen? Because hydroponic farms require less space and water, and growth is alarmingly fast than traditional farming, fruits and vegetables grow quickly. If superfood is available to everyone, there is no fight against hunger. This innovative process also saves water, which means that water is available for many other purposes. Finally, hydroponic agriculture reduces the production of pests and weeds at an alarming rate. Therefore, the use of pesticides, insecticides and herbicides is reduced. The soil is not contaminated. So far, this technological revolution is marginal and much of the research is ongoing. FUTURE PROSPECTS: Hydroponics farming has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its many benefits, including increased crop yields, reduced water usage, and the ability to grow crops in areas with poor soil quality. The future prospects for hydroponics farming look promising, and here are some potential developments that could shape the future of this farming method: Technological Advancements: The use of technology in hydroponics farming is likely to increase, with innovations such as smart sensors and artificial intelligence allowing for more precise control over plant growth and nutrient management. In addition, advancements in lighting technologies, including the use of LEDs, could further optimize plant growth and increase yields.

Hydroponics farming could play a significant role in urban agriculture by allowing crops to be grown in areas where traditional farming is not feasible. Increased Sustainability: As concern about the environmental impact of agriculture continues to grow, there is potential for hydroponics farming to become even more sustainable. This could involve using renewable energy sources to power hydroponic systems, minimizing water usage, and developing closed- loop systems to recycle waste. Commercialization: Hydroponics farming has primarily been used by small-scale and hobbyist growers, but there is potential for commercialization on a larger scale. As demand for locally-grown produce increases, hydroponic farms could become more common and be used to supply produce to supermarkets, restaurants, and other commercial outlets. In conclusion, the future of hydroponics farming looks promising, with advancements in technology, the expansion of crops, integration with urban agriculture, increased sustainability, and potential for commercialization. As research continues, it is likely that hydroponics farming will become an increasingly important method of food production in the coming years. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, hydroponics farming is a promising method of agriculture that offers several benefits, including faster plant growth, higher yields, and reduced water usage. However, proper nutrient and pest management, crop selection, and attention to the potential environmental impact are critical to the success of hydroponics farming. Ongoing research on hydroponics farming will help to further optimize this method of agriculture and expand its potential applications. Hydroponic farming is a highly efficient and innovative method of agriculture that has numerous benefits over traditional soil-based farming. By eliminating the need for soil, hydroponics provides growers with greater control over nutrient uptake, water usage, and environmental conditions, resulting in higher yields and healthier crops. Additionally, hydroponic farming is more sustainable, using less water and pesticides, and producing less waste and pollution than traditional agriculture. Although hydroponic farming requires a significant upfront investment in equipment and infrastructure, it can provide a profitable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional farming methods. With continued research and development, hydroponic farming has the potential to transform the agricultural industry and contribute to a more sustainable future. The future of hydroponics farming looks promising, with advancements in technology, the expansion of crops, integration with urban agriculture, increased sustainability, and potential for commercialization. As research continues, it is likely that hydroponics farming will become an increasingly important method of food production in the coming years. REFERENCES: 1.

The integration of new technologies and research has consistently aimed to enhance cultivation rates and reduce reliance on manual labor. Two key technologies, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), have emerged as pivotal tools in automating processes, providing recommendations, and monitoring agricultural activities to optimize results. While traditional soil cultivation has been the preferred method, the increasing urbanization trend necessitates alternative approaches such as hydroponics, which replaces soil with water as the medium for crop cultivation. Having many signiﬁcant advantages, hydroponics serves a crucial role in achieving eﬃcient space utilization. To get a higher density of plants in a conﬁned area hydroponic approach provides water, nutrients and other essential elements directly to the plant’s root. To utilize the hydroponic system more eﬀectively, our proposed method, integrating AI and IoT helps to provide suitable crop recommendations, monitor the parameters of the plants and also suggest the necessary changes required for gaining optimal parameters. To ensure optimal resource allocation and maximize yields we have used machine learning models and trained them to recommend suitable crops from the given parameters and also refer to the changes in parameters that are needed for better plant growth. We have used the crop recommendation dataset from the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture to train our proposed machine- learning model. Our selected machine learning algorithms to predict the best crops are Random forests, Decision trees, SVM, KNN, and XGBoost. Our research combines AI and IoT with hydroponic systems to streamline crop recommendations, automate monitoring processes, and provide real-time guidance for optimized cultivation. Among them, the Random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms with an accuracy of 97.5%. 1. Introduction Agriculture being one of the important sectors in Asia region, one important way to enhance this agriculture sector can be combining with computational technology. With the rapid advancements in tech- nology, there is a growing need to explore innovative approaches to enhance cultivation rates, reduce reliance on manual labor, and ad- dress the challenges posed by urbanization. Hydroponic systems are a modern method of cultivating crops without the use of soil. Instead, it takes various measures like nutrient-rich water solutions to grow the plants in good condition. When compared to traditional soil-based farm- ing, hydroponic systems oﬀer several advantages. For one, hydroponics * Corresponding author.

However, one of the major things to look over is that, hydroponic system needs careful monitoring and supervision of nutrient and water levels for ensuring positive results from the system. By doing that authors can, understand how diﬀerent crops respond to various nutrient level parameters [36]. Besides that, to perform automated monitoring, crop recommendation and other ac- tions it needs reliable source of electricity. The world is innovating and enriching itself by combining new technology in every section and agri- culture sector is no diﬀerent.

New technologies such as, computer science, data visualization tools, and machine learning can be combined with hydroponic farming to optimize plant growth and resource utiliza- tion. Authors can use various machine learning algorithms which can be trained to predict optimal conditions for plant growth and adjust hydroponic systems by collecting data of important factors of hydro- ponic farming such as, nutrient levels, temperature, humidity and other important features if possible. This will help to improve yields, proper management of waste, reduce the need for manual labor, increasing the accuracy and precision of system adjustments which will increase the overall result of hydroponic farming [6]. This system oﬀers numerous beneﬁts over traditional farming meth- ods, including increased productivity and improved water eﬃciency [17]. Hydroponics also allows for year-round cultivation, regardless of weather conditions, and can be used in urban areas where traditional agriculture may not be feasible. Some main reason for that is urban ar- eas tend to have limited space for farming due to the high demand for land for housing, commercial, and other purposes which leads to poor soil quality and limited access of water [23]. As a result, hydroponic farming has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its nu- merous beneﬁts, including reduced water usage, faster crop growth, and the ability to cultivate crops in urban or otherwise inaccessible ar- eas. Up till now many kinds or techniques of hydroponic system has been introduced and each technique has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Among many techniques, some prefer to use deep wa- ter culture, where plants are suspended in a nutrient-rich solution [24], while others use the NFT(nutrient ﬁlm technique), where a thin ﬁlm of nutrient-rich water continuously ﬂows over the roots of the plants and some use other systems such as ebb and ﬂow, the wick system and so on [18]. Our hydroponic system has been utilized by us focusing on nutri- ent rich solution for plant growth instead of soil-based farming. The pa- rameters of the nutrient solution, including pH, humidity, temperature, and nutrient concentration levels, are closely monitored to ensure accu- racy. Machine learning algorithms are then employed to analyze sensor data from the hydroponic system and make predictions regarding the standard nutrient solution parameters. This predictive model is trained on historical data, encompassing nutrient solution pH, nutrient concen- trations, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Whenever any parameters deviate from the desired range, the user is promptly notiﬁed, and the model suggests appropriate adjustments tai- lored to the speciﬁc crop. This approach eﬀectively enhances yield qual- ity, increases eﬃciency, and enables early detection of potential issues. Cultivating crops and various herbs where traditional farming meth- ods are not feasible can be implemented through hydroponic approach if anyone can monitor and control the nutrient levels and water ﬂow. It is a very popular technique for agriculture in developed countries due to limitations of agricultural area and urbanization. But in our coun- try, it has not been adopted properly yet. Our research team aimed to build a hydroponic system combined with AIoT (Artiﬁcial Intelli- gence of Things) and examine the performance of the system that can be suitable for our climate change. In our work, two techniques (NFT and Tower Garden) are being discussed by our authors that are very popular. Hydroponic system linking with new automation and decision- based technologies has provided the opportunity of growing foods and herbs with more eﬃciency, precision and sustainability. With more research and development in the near future, the advancement of hy- droponic environment will surely take the agriculture sector in a new level. Overall, it can be said that hydroponic farming system has a bright future as the popularity and advertising is growing day by day for sus- tainable and eﬃcient method of growing plants. A system is developed by us incorporating both IoT and machine learning to optimize the growth of various crops by continuous mon- itoring. For suitable crop recommendations a user-friendly web-based framework has been developed. Firstly, IoT sensors collect the data about nutrients from the water and this data is being analyzed by our system and suggests changes in parameters if necessary.

Literature review Our literature review is divided into three sections, each with a dis- tinct focus on hydroponic systems. This categorization’s objective aims to oﬀer a solid comprehension of what hydroponic systems are, their operational patterns, features and application. It has been started by scrutinizing diﬀerent articles and journals providing wholesome insight into the hydroponics domain including its variety and evolution. After- wards our team studied researches that creates comparative narratives between traditional farming practices with these innovative hydroponic methods. Finally, our team delved into research papers that explore new technologies, primarily IoT and machine learning, and how they can en- hance the hydroponic culture. 2.1. Overview of hydroponic system In their study on hydroponics, Gaikwad and Maitra (2020) high- light the manifold beneﬁts of this cultivation method, including eﬃcient nutrient and water utilization, space optimization, and precise control over the growing environment. The authors emphasize the superior- ity of hydroponic systems, particularly the NFT, in terms of producing high-quality and productive vegetables compared to traditional farming methods. They identify six types of hydroponic systems, with the NFT being widely used for growing various vegetables. Various media, such as coco air, perlite, and rice hulls, are utilized to support plant roots in hydroponic systems. Maintaining optimal pH and TDS levels are crucial factors for successful hydroponic cultivation [7]. In a comprehensive overview of hydroponic systems Nisha and col- leagues (2014) refer to hydroponic as an alternative to conventional agricultural practices. The authors discuss diﬀerent hydroponic sys- tems, their functions, and suitability for various plants. Additionally, the article presents a review of research on vegetable cultivation using hydroponic systems and oﬀers insights into water conservation prac- tices and the global market for hydroponic farming [39]. In a comparative analysis by Singh et al., the growth patterns of wheat, spinach, and lily plants were studied over a 2-month period in hydroponic and tap water systems. The experiment revealed that the use of Hoagland solution, a nutrient solution speciﬁcally formulated for hydroponic plant cultivation [49], promoted faster growth compared to tap water. The lengthwise growth of plants indicated that the hydro- ponic system resulted in accelerated plant development compared to tap water [31]. Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) systems, which utilize advanced technologies like artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning to optimize plant growth, have been discussed by Srivani and colleagues [42]. The authors evaluated diﬀerent hydroponic techniques used in CEA systems, including Wick Hydroponic, Ebb and Flow, Drip, DWC (Deepwater Culture), NFT, and Aeroponics. The study also addressed key challenges in CEA with hydroponics, such as power optimiza- tion, energy and water conservation and recycling, and pest manage- ment. [42]. In another experiment, Wiangsamut et al. (2021) investigated the impact of plant spacing in hydroponic systems on the growth of four vegetable species. Tokyo Bekana cabbage exhibited the highest plant density and fresh yield, while Red Coral had the lowest. The DFT10x12 system resulted in signiﬁcantly higher yields and the highest gross ben- eﬁt of vegetable production, except for Red Coral. The study established correlations between fresh yield and plant parameters through statisti- cal analysis. [48]. To address food security challenges, a study focused on hydroponic lettuce cultivation in Uganda explored the physiognomic responses of lettuce to hydroponic techniques. The research aimed to evaluate the growth rate, leaf structure, and nutrient uptake of lettuce in hydroponic Smart Agricultural Technology 8 (2024) 100472 3 M.A. Rahman, N.R. Chakraborty, A.

The literature review in this section covers the beneﬁts and challenges of hydroponic systems for crop culti- vation, including diﬀerent techniques and media used for plant growth.

Hydroponics oﬀers eﬃcient nutrient and water utilization, space con- servation, and environmental control. Various crops such as wheat, spinach, lily water, rice, lettuce, and tomatoes have been studied for their performance in hydroponic systems. Hydroponics is viewed as a potential alternative to conventional farming practices that cause envi- ronmental degradation, particularly in urban and industrialized areas. Advanced technologies such as artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learn- ing are being integrated into hydroponic farming to optimize plant growth and address challenges such as power optimization, energy sav- ing and recycling, water conservation and recycling, and pest manage- ment. Hydroponic systems can provide sustainable and pesticide-free farming while improving the health and quality of crops. 2.2. Comparison between traditional soil system and hydroponic cultivation system In a comparative experiment conducted by Gashgari and his fellow researchers (2018), the growth of cucumber and Armenian cucumber plants was analyzed in both hydroponic and traditional soil systems. Here, Cucumber and Armenian cucumber seeds are categorized by type and numbered sequentially [H(1,1) for cucumber seeds in hydroponic condition, H(2,1) is for American cucumber seeds, S represents the soil based system]. The research targeted the identiﬁcation of how vary- ing seed types and planting systems inﬂuenced plant height and leaf span. After carrying out ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), it was estab- Smart Agricultural Technology 8 (2024) 100472 4 M.A. Rahman, N.R. Chakraborty, A. Suﬁun et al. Fig. 2. Growth of plants and plant’s leaves – 30 days observation (H- Hydroponic, S – Traditional Soil [8]). lished that plants using hydroponic methods showed a signiﬁcantly noticeable increase in height, when compared to their soil-based coun- terparts as illustrated by Fig. 2. However, interestingly enough there wasn’t any meaningful variation discovered pertaining to the length of leaves among both these systems. These ﬁndings support the hypothe- sis that hydroponic systems outperform traditional soil systems in terms of plant growth [8] In a study conducted in 2015 comparing lettuce production in a hydroponic system to conventional farming methods in southwestern Arizona, researchers found that the hydroponic system yielded 11 times more lettuce while using less water. While it’s true that hydroponic farming demanded a bit more energy, the outcomes point that hy- droponic system has the potential to deliver superior crop yields and excellent water-use eﬃciency when contrasted with traditional agri- culture. Focusing eﬀorts on diminishing energy use through enhanced eﬀectiveness and combining renewable power sources would pave the way for sustainable practice [4]. AlShrouf (2017) underscores the signiﬁcance of streamlined food production techniques to cater to an expanding populace. The writer accentuates the advantages of contemporary farming methods like hy- droponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics which bring greater crop vol- umes, less water usage, and incessant cultivation by capitalizing on a resourceful rich-nutrient water solution instead of soil. The utilization of precision agriculture technologies, including sensors, automation, and mobile apps, further enhances farmers’ control and promotes sus- tainability. Hydroponic cultivation, due to its lower usage of water and land in contrast with ordinary farming methods, has showcased the eﬀectiveness of using 10-25 kg/m3 water. Not only does it use substan- tially less amount of water than soil-based agriculture processes but also succeeds in increasing overall productivity [3]. Research conducted in Kashmir, India assessed the impact of deep- water culture, nutrient ﬁlm technique and traditional soil cultivation on lettuce growth as well as ﬁnancial implications with respect to solar radiation. Deep-water culture displayed quick crop maturity and abun- dant yields; however, regular soil-based growing presented increased plant dispersal and leaf surface area. The nutrient ﬁlm method exhib- ited the least productive outcomes. The study indicated that hydroponic systems, particularly deep-water culture, are a sustainable alternative to conventional lettuce cultivation, oﬀering multiple crops per year and water savings which was shown in Fig. 3. The adoption of hydroponic systems in temperate regions could be accelerated by their commercial viability, and future research could explore vertical hydroponic cultiva- tion and automation [20].

Gurung et al. (2019) discovered that hydroponic plants grow faster and produce greater yields than soil-grown plants, with the Hoagland solution being the most eﬀective nutrient solution. The pH of the medium largely controls nutrient absorption, and liquid media are suit- able for seedlings, but solid media are necessary for full maturity. Hy- droponic systems were found to be more productive than conventional soil culture, and hydroponic lettuce had the same quality as organic and ﬁeld lettuces. Hydroponics allows for high plant control with low main- tenance and crop pollution, making it important for global food safety and security [11]. Based on the reviewed papers, it is evident that hydroponic farm- ing has numerous advantages over traditional farming. Hydroponics provides higher yields, water eﬃciency, and continuous production, uti- lizing less water and land. Hydroponic tomato production has a water use eﬃciency of 10-25 kg/m3, with closed systems having higher eﬃ- ciency than open systems. The studies suggest that hydroponic lettuce has similar quality, texture, odor, and taste as organic and ﬁeld-grown lettuces. However, the feasibility of hydroponic farming depends on factors such as water and land availability, government and community support, and the cost-eﬀectiveness of new technologies. If energy con- sumption can be reduced through improved eﬃciency and renewable energy sources, hydroponics can oﬀer a sustainable solution to feed the growing world population [2]. 2.3. Hydroponic system combined with IoT and machine learning In 2018 Mehra and fellow researchers developed a hydroponic sys- tem that utilizes IoT and Deep Neural Networks to control plant growth. The system showed an accuracy rate of 88% in controlling tomato plant growth using data collected by sensors on pH, temperature, humidity, level, and lighting. The system design in Fig. 4 includes sensors con- nected to an Edge device (Arduino and Raspberry Pi3), a Deep Neural Network model for real-time control, and a cloud-based classiﬁcation system. The study demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of the proposed intelli- gent IoT hydroponic system, with enhanced performance and eﬃciency compared to other machine learning algorithms such as Bayesian net- works [22]. In a similar vein, S.V.S. Ramakrishnam Raju and colleagues in 2022, introduced AI-SHES, a smart farming solution for hydroponic operations that integrates Raspberry Pi, IoT, and a mobile app. The system utilizes sensors and deep convolutional neural networks to monitor and control plant statistics in real-time. The system includes Prediction-DLCNN and Classiﬁcation-DLCNN models that predict nutrient levels and identify plant diseases, respectively. The AI-based IoT cloud server accurately classiﬁed various plant diseases and predicted appropriate nutrients us- ing the NUOnet and Plant Village datasets, outperforming traditional methods. The proposed solution aims to address the challenges faced by farmers and improve the performance of hydroponic farming opera- tions [32] (see Fig. 5). In another study, a new tool for plant growth has been developed using hydroponics and machine learning. Sensors like pH sensor, DHT Smart Agricultural Technology 8 (2024) 100472 5 M.A. Rahman, N.R.

The study found positive and negative correlations be- tween the growth parameters and CGR, with Na ions having the highest correlation and Ca ions having the lowest correlation with dry weight matter. The proposed framework considers the dynamics of ion uptake and EC limit during the diﬀerent stages of tomato growth, suggest- ing speciﬁc ion monitoring and adjustments are necessary for optimal growth in hydroponics [47]. Another research explores machine learning algorithms’ eﬀective- ness in analyzing hydroponic system data. Real-time data from sensors measuring temperature, humidity, pH levels, and nutrient concentra- tions is collected. Algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and artiﬁcial neural networks are compared. The evaluation provides insights into their strengths and limitations in predicting plant growth outcomes. The ﬁndings contribute to develop- ing intelligent hydroponic systems for optimized resource utilization and increased productivity. It advances the understanding of machine learning’s potential in revolutionizing plant cultivation and oﬀers prac- tical implications for hydroponic system improvement [17]. From the reviewed research articles, it can be understood that the integration of IoT, machine learning, and deep neural networks can im- prove plant growth and disease detection in hydroponic systems. Real- time control and monitoring of hydroponic parameters can be achieved using sensors, edge devices, cloud-based classiﬁcation systems, and deep neural network models. The eﬀectiveness of using machine learn- ing models is demonstrated for improved accuracy and performance. Speciﬁc parameter monitoring and adjustments are crucial for optimal growth and development in hydroponics. The proposed solutions aim Fig. 7. Nutrient Film Technique process [29]. to improve the performance of hydroponic farming operations, leading to increased proﬁts and reduced losses due to natural disasters. Over- all, IoT, AI and machine learning have potential to optimize hydroponic farming practices. 3. Methodology After the completion of the literature reviews, it can be concluded that combining new technology with soilless agriculture which is re- ferred as hydroponic system, it gives us a chance for innovation in the agricultural sector. It may also be the solution for our future depend- ing on the rise of population, mostly in Asia. Keeping that in our mind, our methodology will explore the use of hydroponic systems for crop cultivation, speciﬁcally focusing on NFT(Nutrient Film Technique) and Tower Garden which basically falls into aeroponic cultivation culture. Both NFT and Tower Garden are good hydroponic systems that can be used to grow plants without soil. Here both IoT and machine learning techniques are incorporated to optimize the growth of various crops by monitoring the parameters of nutrient solutions. In hydroponic systems, the nutrient solution is a mixture of water and essential plant nutrients that is used to grow plants without soil. The nutrient solution provides all the necessary elements for the plant’s growth, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and other micro nutrients [40]. The process of creating a balanced nutrient solution can be done by incorporating fertilizers into water. But it is crucial to guarantee that the plants intake adequate nutrients. Varying plant species require diverse nourishments; henceforth, the proportion of elements in each nutrient solution can diﬀer based on what type of plant it’s intended for. Prior to explaining into the details of our recommended procedure, it’s crucial you understand about two speciﬁc hydroponic setups we’ve selected - NFT(Nutrient Film Technique) and Tower Garden.

This technique operates by propelling nutrient rich water in a thin layer over the roots of plants. Designed to grow within distinct channels or gutters set at slight inclinations which assist in continual recirculation back into its reservoir [46], these NFT-grown crops are typically nestled inside net cups or pots placed strategically within said channels. Granting direct access to crucial nutrients via constant stream supplied through re-circulating rather than repeated reﬁlling; it’s not only resource-eﬃcient both on nutritive values and our valuable water but also cultivates an oxygen-rich environment around roots promot- ing their rapid yet healthy growth. The main components of a Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) Fig. 7 hydroponic system is as follows: 1. Channels: Generally crafted from plastic, these act as the primary framework for an NFT system. They’re purposefully designed with a slight tilt to facilitate the downward ﬂow of nutrients back into their source reservoir. Smart Agricultural Technology 8 (2024) 100472 7 M.A. Rahman, N.R. Chakraborty, A. Suﬁun et al. 2. Nutrient Solution Reservoir: It is kind of a container holding the nutrient-rich water solution for feeding the plants. 3. Pump: The pumping device takes the role of moving this nutrient mix from its container through various ducts or trenches encompass- ing plant roots. Integrated into the system are air stones designed not only to oxygenate our nutrient blend but also facilitate root airing. By creating little bubbles within this mixture, these air stones contribute signiﬁcantly towards enhancing dissolved-oxygen levels in that liquid. 4. Net Cups or Pots: These containers are utilized to secure the plants in place and allow their roots to have contact, with the solution. Typically the net cups or pots are suspended within the channels or gutters. 6. Timer: The timer is employed to regulate the pump ensuring that the nutrient solution ﬂows over the plant roots at intervals. 7. pH and EC (Electrical Conductivity) meters: These devices are utilized to monitor and maintain a pH level and nutrient concentration in the solution, which is crucial for optimal plant growth. In this case sensors are being used to gather data from factors including pH and EC for continuous monitoring. 8. Lighting: Although not essential supplementary lighting can be added to the NFT system to ensure that plants receive light for pho- tosynthesis particularly in indoor environments or areas, with limited natural light. These diﬀerent parts collaborate harmoniously to construct a hydro- ponic system that’s both uncomplicated and eﬀective. It is particularly suitable, for cultivating a range of plants those, with roots that don’t go very deep. Tower Garden: The Tower Garden is a creative implementation of hydroponics, allowing for vertical plant growth in multiple layers or towers constructed from plastic. Esteemed for its versatility and pop- ularity, this system facilitates the cultivation of vegetables, herbs, and other varieties on small platforms such as balconies or interior spaces. It performs by circulating nutrient-fortiﬁed water across plants with a pump that releases it at the tower’s apex. This nutrient solution fur- ther cascades downward through each level eventually dripping onto roots delivering essential elements required to prosper [30]. The adapt- ability extends to diﬀerent growing media compatibility which includes soil, rockwool or coconut coir options within its repertoire. An immense advantage associated with the application arises due to impressive con- servation rates upon usage since up-to 90% less hydration requirements than comparable soil-based farming methods can be expected. In Fig. 8 the components utilized in a Tower Garden can diﬀer based on the design and setup of the system. However here are some used components: 1. Tower structure: Typically made of plastic the tower structure consists of stacked trays or containers where plants and growing media are placed. 2.

Nutrient solution: This formulated mixture contains minerals and nutrients that furnish plants with what they need for healthy growth. The solution is mixed with water and added to the reservoir. 6. pH testing kit: Because the pH of the nutrient solution can aﬀect the plants’ ability to absorb nutrients, a pH testing kit is used to monitor and adjust the pH levels as needed. 7. Trellis: A trellis is often used to support vining plants, such as tomatoes or cucumbers, as they grow upward in the tower. Fig. 8. Tower Garden process [27]. Overall, the components of a Tower Garden work together to create an eﬃcient and productive hydroponic system that allows for vertical growing of a variety of plants. As discussed before both the techniques (NFT and Tower Garden), now it needs to combine them with IoT and machine learning to achieve our goal, which is crop recommendation and monitoring. Our proposed method actually can be divided into two main parts. Firstly, the sensor is implemented to get the required data and secondly, after getting the desired data, concentrated on the nutrient solution and other prime factors to recommend and monitor the plants in the hydroponic system. More details are given below, 3.1. Role of IoT (identifying the sensors for diﬀerent types of parameter): IoT stands for “Internet of Things,” and it refers to the network of physical objects (such as sensors, devices, and appliances) that are connected to the internet, enabling them to collect and exchange data. Using IoT, hydroponic systems can be monitored and controlled in as- pects such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, and nutrient levels. This is done through sensors that are connected to a central computer or mobile device. When all this data is collected it’s easy to make adjust- ments that beneﬁt the system. Another great use of IoT in hydroponics is automation. It can automate tasks like watering, nutrient dosing, and lighting [25]. Hydroponic systems using IoT have been able to grow plants better by having complete control over what conditions the plants grow in. This has led to an increase in yields, improved qual- ity, and eﬃcient use of resources (see Table 1). These are the main sensors to cover up our data collection part from the nutrient solution and also to measure the perfect humidity. Besides these sensors, there are other sensors that can be used to enhance more monitoring power in a hydroponic system. Such as, light sensor which is used to measure the intensity of the light that the plants are receiv- ing. This data can be used to adjust the lighting system and ensure that the plants are receiving the optimal amount of light for their growth stage. Temperature sensors allow growers to monitor and control the temperature of the growing environment. Temperature sensors are an important tool for maintaining optimal growing conditions in hydro- ponic systems, leading to improved plant growth, reduced risk of plant stress or failure, and more eﬃcient use of resources.

This is an important measure of the nutrient concentration in the solution. TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensors (An electrical current is passed between the electrodes, and the resistance of the solution is measured. The resistance is inversely proportional to the electrical conductivity of the solution, which is a measure of the concentration of dissolved salts (including nutrients) in the solution) [15]. Humidity Sensor A humidity sensor measures the amount of moisture in the air. This can help growers maintain proper humidity levels for optimal plant growth. DHT11/DHT22 (detects changes in capacitance caused by changes in the moisture content of the air) Detecting Nitrogen, Potassium, and Phosphorus Nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus are all essential nutrients for plant growth and development. Monitoring their levels in the nutrient solution ensures that plants have access to the nutrients they need to grow and produce high-quality crops. Ion-Selective Electrodes (detect speciﬁc ions, including nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. These sensors work by measuring the electrical potential diﬀerence between an electrode and a reference electrode, which is proportional to the concentration of the ion being measured.) [12] 3.2. Role of machine learning (processing diﬀerent types of parameters): Machine learning enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves building models that can learn and make decisions based on patterns and relationships within the data. In hydroponic systems, machine learning can be used to improve the eﬃciency and produc- tivity of the system, by analyzing data collected from various sensors and making decisions or adjustments based on that data. By consider- ing various factors like plant growth stage, environmental conditions, and nutrient requirements, machine learning models can recommend adjustments to optimize resource utilization and minimize waste. By promptly identifying anomalies, the system can take corrective actions or notify operators to prevent any adverse eﬀects on plant health. As a result, machine learning plays a vital role in processing diﬀerent types of parameters in hydroponic systems. To train our machine learning model authors used the crop recom- mendation dataset from the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture. The dataset consists of many combinations of parameters for various crops. The parameters are Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, tempera- ture, pH, Humidity, and rainfall. By focusing on those parameters, this study has trained machine-learning model for predicting the right crops for the right conditions. This dataset has more than 2000 inputs of data for various crops. Such as bananas, rice, jute, apples, etc. Authors can also further analyze the dataset to get standard parameters of a selective crop for parameter recommendation. Then preprocess the dataset to ensure that the data is in a format that can be used eﬀectively by machine learning algorithms and that the model is trained on clean, reliable, and relevant data, which can improve the accuracy, eﬃciency, and generalizability of the model. Handling missing values in features such as pH, N, P, and tempera- ture. Also handled inconsistent data, such as variations in the format of the data. Then transformed the data, which is also referred as nor- malization so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This process scales the data to a similar range and helps in bet- ter convergence and faster training of the machine learning model. The correlation matrix in Fig. 9 shows the relationships between dif- ferent variables in the dataset. Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) have a negative correlation, meaning higher levels of one tends to be asso- ciated with lower levels of the other. Nitrogen (N) and Potassium (K) also have a negative correlation, while Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) have a positive correlation. There are generally weak correlations between temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and other variables. The speciﬁc correlations vary, with some positive and negative associations observed.

Correlation between the parameters of the dataset. preprocessing technique is data splitting which will be discussed in the following part. Then divided the dataset into training and testing sets which is also referred as data splitting. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model. For building our machine learning model we will split 80 percent of the data as training data and the remaining 20 percent as testing data. Five machine learning algorithms have been selected to predict the best crops from the given parameters. They are, random forest, deci- sion trees, svm, knn, and xgboost. Based on the other similar studies it can be concluded that these ﬁve algorithms work well on the given dataset with proper tuning [45] [5] [33] [44]. As the dataset consists of only few parameters or features, that authors have used hyper pa- rameter tuning carefully to improve our model’s accuracy. The selected algorithms are explained in the following, Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve ac- curacy. It randomly selects subsets of features for each tree, and the ﬁnal prediction is determined by majority voting [16]. Decision Tree: Decision trees recursively partition the data based on features to create a tree-like model. Predictions are made by traversing the tree based on the values of features, following decision rules at each node [14]. Smart Agricultural Technology 8 (2024) 100472 9 M.A. Rahman, N.R. Chakraborty, A. Suﬁun et al. Fig. 10. Accuracy of the ML Algorithms. Table 2 Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms.

It can handle linear and non-linear separable data using kernel functions [28]. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN predicts the class of a new data point by considering the classes of its nearest neighbors. The majority class among the k nearest neighbors determines the ﬁnal prediction [10]. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): XGBoost uses a sequence of decision trees to make predictions. Each subsequent tree corrects the errors of the previous trees, resulting in improved predictions [38]. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, multiple evaluation metrics have been used which includes accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. As we split the dataset into training and testing sets using a 80:20 ratio. This process is being repeated ﬁve times and computed the mean and standard deviation of the evaluation metrics for each algo- rithm. This means that, a new random split was performed between the training and testing data. This is done to ensure that the evaluation is not biased towards a particular split of the data. The mean provides an estimate of the average performance of the algorithm, while the standard deviation provides a measure of the variability or uncertainty in the performance estimate. Cross validation is also used to evalu- ate model performance by splitting the data into 5 subsets, training the model on 4 subsets, and evaluating it on the remaining subset it- eratively, providing a robust estimation of the model’s generalization ability. By computing the mean and standard deviation across multi- ple evaluations, authors got a more reliable estimate of the algorithm’s performance. Table 2 and Fig. 10 summarize the accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall for each of the ﬁve algorithms. Based on these results, it can be concluded that Decision Tree, Ran- dom Forest, and XGBoost achieved high accuracy and balanced perfor- mance across the evaluated metrics, while SVM had lower accuracy but higher precision.

Role of AIOT (IoT and machine learning) AIoT can be deﬁned as the integration of machine learning and deep learning, with IoT devices. In AIoT, machine learning algorithms are used to analyze data collected by IoT devices, such as sensors, cameras, and other connected devices [50]. This analysis can be used to iden- tify patterns, predict outcomes, and make decisions based on the data. In our proposed method, AIoT has been used for continuously monitor- ing the nutrient solution of the water for better crop growth. Machine learning algorithms have been used to analyze the data of humidity, pH, and nutrient levels collected from hydroponic systems to identify patterns and correlations that can be used to monitor and identify the optimal conditions for plant growth [43]. This information and metrics are used to refer the hydroponic system’s settings to create the ideal growing conditions for the plants. 3.4. Flowchart and process To commence hydroponic cultivation according to our ﬂowchart in Fig. 11, there are two alternatives. Firstly, anyone can opt for a speciﬁc crop and subsequently identify and supervise its growth. Al- ternatively, it may utilize crop recommendations to suggest a speciﬁc crop suitable for hydroponic cultivation, as determined by the machine. Subsequently, regardless of our choice in the initial stage, the subse- quent step involves analyzing nutrient solution parameters, pH levels, and humidity. Our goal is being reached by using three detectors to col- lect information about levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the nutrient mix, as well as pH balance and moisture surroundings within the hydroponic farming system. The sensors are listed in Table 3. Our research employs a highly specialized machine-learning model to process the sensor data collected from our hydroponic system. Seam- less and eﬃcient wireless communication is achieved through the uti- lization of cloud computing. The sensors are connected to an ESP32 microcontroller, chosen for its exceptional reliability and low failure probability in transmitting data to the cloud via Bluetooth [41]. The ESP32 is renowned for its robust Bluetooth capabilities and built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, making it ideal for transmitting data to the cloud with ﬂexibility in communication options [21]. By integrating with sen- sors that monitor parameters such as pH, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels, the ESP32 wirelessly transmits this data to the cloud [13], where it is stored, analyzed, and encoded in XML format for ef- ﬁcient transmission. Cloud-based services receive the transmitted data, enabling real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and crop recommen- dations. Furthermore, the ESP32 facilitates automation of hydroponic Smart Agricultural Technology 8 (2024) 100472 10 M.A. Rahman, N.R. Chakraborty, A. Suﬁun et al. Fig. 11. Overall process of our proposed approach combining IoT and machine learning. Table 3 Sensors and Descriptions. Sensors Description An NPK sensor is a device that measures the levels of three key nutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The NPK sensor provides real-time measurements to farmers so they can make adjustments accordingly. This is important because it ensures that crops get the amount of nutrients they need at the perfect time. [1]. NPK Sensor The pH sensor is a device that measures how much acid or base there is in a liquid. It usually does this by using a glass electrode. The scale it uses goes from 0 to 14. With 7 being the sweet spot for neutral, anything below that is acidic, and from there on up to 14 it’s alkaline or basic. This helps farmers ﬁgure out the levels of nutrient solution and adjust the pH condition using water to make sure they grow healthy and strong.

Table 4 Observation of lettuce plant between Standard parameter comparison and Crop recommendation parameters comparison. Data Parameter checking Anomaly detection Checking Frequency Crop Recommendation We can check and compare the parameters with no issue. Anomalies are seen in regular intervals. In this case, the parameters are too sensitive, and even a slight change causes alerts to the farmer/cultivator, creating a higher workload. The frequency of checking the parameters is too high. Nutrient levels need to be checked every hour, resulting in more time and eﬀort monitoring and adjusting the system. Standard Parameter We can check and compare the parameters with no issue. Anomalies are not seen in regular intervals. Standard parameters help maintain consistency in adjusting the hydroponic condition, reducing the likelihood of plant stress or nutrient deﬁciencies. Anomalies are not observed on a regular basis, reducing the need for frequent checks. It is important to check the hydroponic system regularly in the ﬁrst week to ensure sensors and monitoring systems are working correctly. Regular checks can also help identify issues that sensors or systems may not detect. system components and provides remote access for enhanced eﬃciency and optimal growth conditions. After the data are extracted from the sensors, the next part will be covered through machine learning. Through careful analysis of the nu- trient levels, the best-trained machine learning model will be able to provide recommendations of the most suitable crops to cultivate in the given conditions. It will also recommend if any changes are required or not to provide the best hydroponic solution. Now that this study has identiﬁed the crop from the previous stages, our attention will be on observing the plant in our hydroponic setup. Our objective is to conﬁrm that the parameters are appropriate for the crop’s optimal growth using machine learning by analyzing the current parameters. This initial monitoring stage will involve checking the nu- trient levels, pH, temperature, and humidity of the nutrient solution and hydroponic environment. In hydroponic cultivation, proper parameter levels and monitoriza- tion are crucial for successful growth. Keeping that in mind, if the parameters are in the right manner the cultivation process can continue in hydroponic condition with those parameters. But if the parameters are not optimal, a second monitoring phase is triggered. In this second monitoring phase, we tend to overcome the changes that will improve the crop’s optimal growth in this condition. Every cop has a standard pa- rameter that helps the crops to maintain a steady growth. So to compare the current nutrient levels of the chosen crop to its standard parameters, which help to maintain consistent growth. This enables us to identify any necessary nutrient level adjustments to ensure ideal cultivation. Comparing the parameters with the standard parameter to optimize our model’s performance instead of using the same crop recommendation dataset. This helps to maintain constantly recommended parameters for a long-term process so that the parameters do not need to change quite often. This study conducted a simple lettuce cultivation test to assess our model’s eﬃciency by comparing standard parameters with the crop rec- ommendation dataset. Table 4 shows the result. During the cultivation of lettuce plants, this study initially involved manual checks of the hydroponic conditions, typically 5-6 times a day, which reduced to 3-4 times a day during the growing phase. However, by implementing standard parameters for system adjustment, authors were able to optimize the settings and minimize the need for manual monitoring.

Nonetheless, we successfully demonstrated the eﬃcacy of manual data collection, which allowed us to monitor the lettuce plant. By leveraging machine learning techniques (as shown in Fig. 12[a]), this study achieved robust growth and a healthy lettuce plant. To sup- port the cultivation process, this study procured a nutrient solution speciﬁcally formulated for hydroponic cultivation (Fig. 12[b]), con- taining all the necessary NPK ingredients required for lettuce growth. Although further research is required to fully automate the monitoring and recommendation system, our ﬁndings highlight the signiﬁcance of standard parameters in ensuring consistent and successful lettuce culti- vation. 4. Result and discussion The results of our study demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of an AIOT- based automated monitoring and recommendation system in hydro- ponic conditions. This study conducted validation tests on lettuce plant using both NFT and Tower Garden methods, with limited resources available. Selecting the lettuce plant for our study came after consid- ering its short growth cycle, ranging from 4 to 8 weeks. This allowed us to gather data and draw conclusions quicker than with other vari- eties of crops. Lettuce also has relatively a simple nutrient requirement which made it easier for us to manage the hydroponic nutrient solution eﬀectively. Throughout this work process, our team manually handled system parameters such as temperature, pH levels, humidity conditions and nourishment needs that are essential in fostering proper develop- ment of lettuce plant. With precise regulation practices implemented during experimentation phases resulted in positive improvements on overall ﬁtness measures relating to the progression of the lettuce plants. Moreover, closely monitoring lettuces’ physical attributes designated ideal harvesting times when they grew within lengths between 20 to 30 centimeters; green leaves resonated well displaying their healthy state consistently. Besides that, the leaves were 7.5 to 15 cm long, showing oﬀ both crisp and tender texture forming a balance moisture-crunch ra- tio throughout. Additionally, this involved applying machine learning techniques aimed mainly to provide crop recommendations and refer- ring the right parameters for suitable crop. By comparing the monitored parameters against established standard values, our system was able to recommend suitable crops for cultivation. Moreover, it determined the best combination of parameters and nutrient solutions tailored to the speciﬁc crop requirements. The Random Forest algorithm, which we employed for crop recommendation, achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97.5%. Despite the manual monitoring process, a user-friendly web-based framework has been developed (Fig. 13) that facilitates easy data in- put and access to recommended crops. This framework enables users to check the optimality of parameters for speciﬁc crops, providing a prac- tical and user-centric solution. Another motive for this framework is to present a graphical user interface to the user for this whole method. When connected to IoT sensors the data will automatically transfer to the hosting website using Bluetooth Serial Communication and will feel the parameters accordingly. In this case, a demo has been shown in Fig. 13[a,b,c,d]. These results highlight the substantial improvements in crop qual- ity that can be achieved through continuous monitoring and machine learning-based recommendations in hydroponic environments. By har- nessing the power of technology, it can be optimized the growth condi- tions and ensure the production of high-quality crops.

A real time validation test is conducted using lettuce plant using both NFT and Tower Garden methods to analyze the whole process manually and compare with the system to evaluate the performance of the model. For crop recommendations an impressive accuracy has achieved using Random Forest algorithm. Authors devel- oped a user-friendly web-based framework that can recommend crops for suitable input parameters. In this study, authors showcased the value of integrating IoT sensors and machine learning practices for overseeing crops along with their apt conditions in hydroponic settings speciﬁcally NFT and Tower Garden systems. Using data derived from nutrient solu- tions allowed us to constantly observe essential factors impacting plant health and growth. The use of IoT sensor integration presents an oppor- tunity for live-time data harvest which facilitates quick identiﬁcation if there are any shifts away from ideal conditions needed for plants’ development. Implementation of machine learning methods helped in creating a crop recommendation system based on given parameters while also applying those compiled parameters as suggestions towards accomplishing improved growth rate success within hydroponic en- vironments. This system oﬀers vital foresight empowering cultivators to make knowledge-based decisions thereby optimizing their produce yield. The results of our study highlight the potential of AIOT, a new trending technology in revolutionizing hydroponic farming. By leverag- ing these technologies, the accuracy and eﬃciency of plant monitoring can be enhanced, leading to improved crop management practices. Experimental result of this study clariﬁes that hydroponic system is suitable for our environment and in urban area it is a better choice rather than traditional cultivation. Furthermore, the ability to detect anomalies and promptly address them contributes to reducing crop losses and maximizing resource utilization. It is important to acknowledge that while this research has yielded promising outcomes, certain limitations should be considered. The ef- fectiveness of the crop recommendation system heavily relies on the quality and accuracy of the input data collected by the IoT sensors. If authors can get more features and data based on the hydroponic envi- ronment this model can be trained with more options which will surely improve the model’s accuracy. Besides that, electric power consump- tion and pricing are other two matters which should be considered as well. The various components of the system require a continuous power supply to operate eﬀectively. On the other hand, the installa- tion and setup of the system, including the purchase of IoT sensors, and other necessary equipment, can be costly. Additionally, maintenance and replacement costs for these components may also contribute to higher operational expenses. Minimizing power consumption through the use of energy-eﬃcient equipment or optimizing the system’s de- sign and exploring cost-eﬀective alternatives, implementing eﬃcient resource management strategies, and assessing the long-term beneﬁts of the system are potential ways to mitigate this to enhance this ap- proach. In conclusion, our research underscores the potential of IoT sensor integration and machine learning techniques in revolutionizing hydro- ponic farming. By providing real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and crop recommendation, this approach holds promise for enhancing crop yield and sustainability in hydroponic systems. As advancements in technology continue to evolve, this study anticipates further devel- opments and applications of IoT and machine learning in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture, driving innovation and enabling more eﬃcient and sustainable farming practices. Our future work will focus on reﬁn- ing data collection methodologies and exploring additional parameters to improve the precision and reliability of the system.

Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) offers a holistic approach to address these challenges by sustainably increasing agricultural productivity, enhancing resilience to climate change, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This paper examines key CSA strategies, including conservation agriculture, efficient water management, improved livestock management, climate-resilient crop varieties, and climate information services. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy, highlighting their potential impacts on soil health, water resources, biodiversity, and farmer livelihoods. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of context-specific implementation, considering the unique agro-ecological, socio-economic, and technological contexts of different farming systems. By integrating these strategies and fostering strong partnerships among farmers, researchers, and policymakers, we can build more resilient and sustainable agricultural systems that can withstand the impacts of climate change and ensure food security for future generations. Keywords: Climate change, food security, resilience, climate smart agriculture (csa), sustainable agriculture Introduction Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an integrated approach to agriculture that aims to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes, adapt to climate change, enhance resilience to climate change, and reduce greenhouse gas emission. It is a multifaceted approach that considers the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic factors. Particularly in developing nations, farmers have modified their farming methods to accommodate the shifting climate and other difficulties (Nyasimi et al., 2017) [12]. Improved fodder production, the use of novel crop and animal breeds, water conservation technology, and soil and land management techniques are some of the ways that agricultural methods are evolving to target both livestock and crop productions (Sattar et al., 2017) [16]. These technologies (also known as CSA technologies) and practices are expected to improve food security, adaptive capability, and climate change mitigation in resource-poor small-scale agricultural systems (Hellin and Fisher, 2019) [7]. The detrimental effects of climatic variability on agriculture can be considerably mitigated by using CSA technology and practices separately or in combination (Ali and Erenstein, 2017) [1]. Another definition of CSA is a contemporary agricultural system that can: i) boost yields, ii) manage climate extremes, and iii) help find answers to climate change. According to Chandra et al. (2018) [4], CSA systems are made to maximize input consumption and use efficient management techniques following harvest. The goal of the CSA system is to improve productivity and adaptability while lowering (mitigating) greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on contemporary agricultural practices (World Bank, 2011) [18]. In addition, CSA is different from \"business-as-usual\" approaches in that it contributes to the improvement of farmers' adaptive capacity, agricultural production system adaptation, and resource use efficiency by strengthening the coordination of efforts by farmers, researchers, the private sector, civil society, and policymakers (Lipper et al., 2014) [10]. International Journal of Research in Agronomy https://www.agronomyjournals.com ~ 702 ~ According to Rosenstock et al. (2016) [15], adaptation and food security are commonly seen as the two most obvious objectives for agricultural development in the context of climate change, out of the three pillars of CSA (Azadi et al., 2021) [2]. However, some detractors have questioned the justification for small-scale farmers' CSA mitigation aims, which has led to more thorough discussions regarding the role of mitigation within a larger CSA approach (Lipper et al., 2014) [10]. Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture Global population growth, urbanization, climate change, and environmental stressors have all put enormous strain on the agricultural system's ability to use resources. According to estimates from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in order to feed the world's projected 9 billion people", "meta": {"title": "Climate-Smart Agriculture: Strategies for Resilient Farming Systems", "org": "IJRA", "year": "2022", "file": "Climate-smart agriculture Strategies for resilient farming systems IJRA.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture Global population growth, urbanization, climate change, and environmental stressors have all put enormous strain on the agricultural system's ability to use resources. According to estimates from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in order to feed the world's projected 9 billion people by 2050, food production must rise by at least 60% (FAO, 2014) [5]. Given that one in eight people today experience food insecurity and that climate change and variability have a major impact on agriculture, this presents a serious problem for global agriculture (Ghosh, 2019) [6]. In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a warning that the world's climate has been changing and would likely continue to do so for some time to come (IPCC, 2014) [9]. By the end of this century, the average global surface temperature is expected to rise by 1.4 to 5.8°C over 1990 levels. Changes in climate variability and the frequency and severity of some extreme climatic events would also occur, resulting in more frequent floods, droughts, cyclones, and glacier retreat over time, as well as uncertain monsoon onsets (IPCC, 2001) [8]. A serious danger to agriculture, climate change has been shown to increase food production instability and negatively impact food security and the livelihoods of millions of people across numerous nations. The production of crops, fisheries, forestry, and aquaculture would be directly and negatively impacted by rising temperatures and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events like floods and droughts, according to the IPCC (2014) [9]. According to a number of studies (Brida and Owiyo, 2013; Lobell et al., 2012; Prasanna, 2014; Singh et al., 2013) [3, 11, 14, 17], rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events could all have a negative impact on agricultural output. According to Porter et al. (2014) [13], depending on the region, future temperature scenarios, and anticipated years, the estimated yield loss from climate change can reach up to 35% for rice, 20% for wheat, 50% for sorghum, 13% for barley, and 60% for maize. As a result, climate unpredictability and change are becoming major threats to global food security, especially in developing and impoverished nations. As one of the world's most densely populated regions, South Asia is particularly vulnerable to climate change and unpredictability; without adaptation and mitigation, this could have a significant impact on poverty, food security, and other developmental objectives (IPCC, 2014) [9]. Key Strategies of CSA for Resilient Farming Systems: There are a few strategies of CSA for resilient farming systems (Chandra et al., 2018; Ghosh, 2019; Azadi et al., 2021 and Sarma et al., 2024) [4, 6, 2, 19] which have been discussed here (fig. 1): Fig 1: Key Strategies of CSA for Resilient Farming Systems 1. Sustainable Land Management a) Conservation Agriculture: Minimizes soil disturbance, maintains permanent soil cover, and promotes crop diversity. This helps to improve soil health, reduce erosion, and enhance water retention. It includes: • No-till or Reduced Tillage: This involves minimizing soil disturbance during cultivation. By leaving crop residues on the surface, it reduces soil erosion (Strong winds and heavy rains can wash away topsoil, leading to nutrient loss and decreased fertility), improves soil structure (Minimizes compaction, allowing for better water infiltration and root growth) and increases organic matter (Crop residues decompose, enriching the soil with nutrients). • Crop Rotation: Instead of planting the same crop year after year, farmers rotate different crops. This breaks disease and pest cycles (Reduces the buildup of pests and diseases specific to one crop), improves soil health (Different crops have varying root structures and nutrient requirements, leading to better soil aeration and nutrient cycling) and increases biodiversity (Supports a wider range of beneficial organisms in the soil). • Cover Cropping: Planting cover crops between main crops International Journal of Research in Agronomy https://www.agronomyjournals.com ~ 703 ~ (like legumes, grasses, or brassicas) helps protect soil (Prevents erosion and moisture loss), suppress weeds (Reduces competition for water and nutrients) and improve soil fertility (Some cover crops (legumes) fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, enriching the soil). b) Agroforestry: Integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes and with crops or", "meta": {"title": "Climate-Smart Agriculture: Strategies for Resilient Farming Systems", "org": "IJRA", "year": "2022", "file": "Climate-smart agriculture Strategies for resilient farming systems IJRA.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

It reduces reliance on synthetic pesticides, which can harm beneficial insects and pollinate 2. Soil fertility management CSA places a strong emphasis on sustainable soil management practices. Healthy soils are crucial for increasing agricultural productivity, enhancing resilience to climate change, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here's a detailed list of key soil management strategies for CSA. By implementing these soil management strategies, farmers can enhance soil health, increase agricultural productivity, and build more resilient and sustainable farming systems that can withstand the challenges of climate change. a. Soil Organic Matter Management • Composting and Organic Inputs: Incorporating compost, animal manure, and green manure into the soil increases organic matter (Improves soil structure, water-holding capacity, and nutrient availability), enhances microbial activity (Supports a healthy soil ecosystem). • Cover Cropping for Green Manure: Growing and then tilling cover crops into the soil adds organic matter and nutrients (Enriches the soil with nitrogen, carbon, and other essential elements), improves soil structure (Increases soil porosity and water infiltration). b. Nutrient Management Precision Fertilization: Applying fertilizers precisely based on soil tests and crop needs reduces fertilizer waste (Minimizes nutrient runoff and leaching, protecting water quality) and improves fertilizer use efficiency (Ensures crops receive the right amount of nutrients at the right time).Organic Fertilizers: Utilizing organic fertilizers like compost, manure, and green manure improves soil health (Enhances soil structure, water- holding capacity, and nutrient availability), reduces reliance on synthetic fertilizers (Minimizes environmental impact and potential pollution). c. Soil Health Monitoring Regular Soil Testing: Assessing soil properties like pH, nutrient levels, and organic matter content provides valuable information (Helps farmers make informed decisions about soil management practices), tracks progress (Monitors the effectiveness of soil health improvement efforts). 3. Efficient Water Management Use water-saving practices like drip irrigation and rainwater collection to ensure crops receive enough water, even during droughts. a) Water Harvesting and Storage: Collecting and storing rainwater for use during dry periods. b) Efficient Irrigation Techniques: Using drip irrigation or other efficient methods to minimize water loss. c) Drought-Tolerant Crops: Selecting and breeding crops that are more resistant to drought stress. d) Precision Irrigation: This involves using technologies like drip irrigation or sprinklers to deliver water directly to plant roots. This reduces water waste (Minimizes runoff and evaporation, saving water and money), improves water use efficiency (Plants receive the exact amount of water they need), reduces nutrient leaching (Prevents fertilizers from being washed away with excess water) and rainwater Harvesting (Collecting and storing rainwater in tanks or reservoirs: Provides a reliable water source during dry periods, reduces reliance on groundwater, which is often overexploited). e) Mulching: Applying organic or inorganic materials (like straw, plastic, or rocks) around plants reduces evaporation: Prevents soil moisture from escaping into the atmosphere, suppresses weeds: Creates a barrier that prevents weed seeds from germinating, maintains soil temperature: Helps regulate soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat or cold. 4. Improved Livestock Management a) Improved Feed Efficiency: Optimizing livestock diets can: • Reduce methane emissions: Some feed additives can decrease the production of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by ruminant animals (like cows and sheep). • Improve animal health and productivity: A balanced diet leads to healthier animals, which are more efficient at converting feed into meat or milk. b) Manure Management: Proper handling and utilization of manure: • Reduces greenhouse gas emissions: Anaerobic decomposition of manure in open areas releases methane. Proper storage and composting can minimize these", "meta": {"title": "Climate-Smart Agriculture: Strategies for Resilient Farming Systems", "org": "IJRA", "year": "2022", "file": "Climate-smart agriculture Strategies for resilient farming systems IJRA.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Improved Crop Varieties a) Climate-Resilient Crop Varieties • Developing and promoting drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, and pest-resistant crop varieties. • Early and late planting: Adjusting planting dates to avoid extreme weather events. International Journal of Research in Agronomy https://www.agronomyjournals.com ~ 704 ~ b) Crop diversification: Growing a variety of crops can help to reduce risk and improve resilience to climate variability. Plant a variety of crops to reduce the risk of adverse weather conditions, pests, and diseases. Diversifying crops can also improve soil health. 6. Policy and Institutional Support a) Supporting research and development: Investing in research to develop and disseminate climate-smart agricultural technologies and practices. b) Creating enabling policy environments: Providing incentives for farmers to adopt CSA practices, such as subsidies and tax breaks. c) Strengthening farmer organizations: Empowering farmers to participate in decision-making processes and access information and resources. 7. Agricultural extension Provide access to effective agricultural extension services to help farmers adopt climate-resilient crops. Climate Information Services: a) Providing farmers with access to weather forecasts, climate information, and early warning systems. b) Developing and disseminating climate-smart agricultural knowledge and practices. c) Strengthening agricultural extension services to support farmers in adopting CSA practices. By implementing these strategies, farmers can build more resilient and sustainable agricultural systems that can withstand the challenges of climate change while ensuring food security and livelihoods for future generations. Critical analysis of different Key Strategies of CSA for Resilient Farming Systems CSA encompasses a diverse set of strategies, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Conservation Agriculture focuses on improving soil health through reduced tillage, crop rotation, and cover cropping, offering benefits like reduced erosion and enhanced biodiversity, but may require significant initial investment and careful weed management (Chandra et al., 2018) [4]. Efficient Water Management, such as precision irrigation and rainwater harvesting, optimizes water use and reduces waste, but can be costly and require technical expertise. Improved Livestock Management, including optimizing feed and managing manure, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves soil fertility, but requires careful planning and may present challenges with odour and pollution (Ghosh, 2019 and Azadi et al., 2021) [6, 2]. Climate-Resilient Crop Varieties enhance resilience to climate change by increasing yield stability and ensuring food security, but require long-term research and development. Finally, Climate Information Services empower farmers with weather forecasts and early warning systems, improving decision-making and reducing risk, but may require improved access to information and data interpretation skills. The most effective CSA approach will vary depending on specific conditions and requires careful consideration of synergies and trade-offs between different strategies. (Chandra et al., 2018 and Sarma et al., 2024) [4, 19]. Conclusion Comprehensive research on reliable intelligent agriculture tools, like the drones that are now on the market for field spraying, could contribute to the growth of the smart agricultural ecosystem and the fight against climate change. Nevertheless, the environment in which these inventions are used is frequently overlooked in research on them. Certain elements of the intricate, smart agricultural ecosystem—like farm equipment, labor sharing, and organizational choices—are impacted by environmental factors. Smart farming-specific security measures are required due to domain-specific problems such as location, user skill level, insider threats, and generated data. Therefore, before smart farm technology is extensively adopted in the community, more research is required. References 1. Ali A, Erenstein O.

Climate change presents a significant threat to agriculture, particularly in countries like India. This research paper explores the impact of CSA strategies on Indian agriculture, focusing on their effects on productivity, sustainability, and farmer resilience. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, coupled with an analysis of official data from the Government of India, this study identifies key CSA practices implemented across various regions of India. These practices include conservation tillage, agroforestry, improved crop varieties, and water-efficient irrigation systems. Quantitative data reveals that CSA practices have led to measurable improvements in crop yields and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, the adoption of water-efficient irrigation techniques has shown a 12% increase in yield while reducing emissions by 7%. Similarly, the introduction of drought-resistant crop varieties has enhanced productivity by 20%, contributing to greater food security. This paper concludes by providing recommendations for policymakers, agricultural stakeholders, and researchers to enhance the adoption and effectiveness of CSA in India, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and sustainable agricultural sector. Madrewar, Dhinwa, Sah, Bhosale, Gumphekar 742 INTRODUCTION Agriculture is the backbone of India's economy, providing employment to nearly half of the country's workforce and contributing significantly to its GDP. However, this critical sector faces unprecedented challenges due to climate change. Increasing temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events such as floods and droughts threaten agricultural productivity, food security, and the livelihoods of millions of farmers. In a country where the majority of farms are small and marginal, the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change cannot be overstated. In response to these challenges, Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a comprehensive approach to managing agricultural systems sustainably. CSA aims to achieve three main objectives: increasing agricultural productivity, building resilience to climate change, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Unlike traditional agricultural practices, CSA involves the adoption of innovative techniques and practices that are not only environmentally sustainable but also economically viable for farmers. India, with its diverse agro-ecological zones, has witnessed a growing interest in CSA practices. The country’s government, recognizing the potential of CSA to enhance food security and support sustainable development, has introduced several initiatives to promote the adoption of CSA practices among farmers. Programs such as the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) aim to support farmers by providing financial assistance, promoting water-efficient irrigation systems, and encouraging the use of climate-resilient crop varieties. Despite these efforts, the adoption of CSA practices in India remains uneven. While some regions have successfully integrated CSA into their agricultural systems, others lag behind due to various barriers such as financial constraints, lack of access to technology, and insufficient knowledge. The effectiveness of CSA in improving agricultural productivity, sustainability, and resilience is also influenced by factors such as regional climate conditions, soil types, and water availability. This research paper seeks to explore the impact of CSA strategies on Indian farmers by analyzing the adoption rates, effectiveness, and challenges associated with key CSA practices. The paper focuses on four primary CSA strategies: conservation tillage, agroforestry, improved crop varieties, and water-efficient irrigation systems.

This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable agriculture by providing insights into how CSA can be leveraged to achieve a more resilient and sustainable agricultural sector in India. LITERATURE REVIEW The concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged in response to the growing recognition that agriculture must adapt to the changing climate while simultaneously reducing its environmental impact. As articulated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2010, CSA aims to achieve three primary goals: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity, enhancing resilience (adaptation), and reducing or removing greenhouse gases (mitigation) where possible. Since its introduction, CSA has gained traction globally, particularly in regions like South Asia, where the impacts of climate change are acutely felt. This literature review explores the development and implementation of CSA in India, examining its effectiveness, challenges, and the role of various stakeholders in promoting CSA practices. Evolution of Climate-Smart Agriculture CSA is rooted in the broader concept of sustainable agriculture, which emphasizes practices that meet present agricultural needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. Early CSA initiatives focused on integrating climate resilience into agricultural practices, recognizing that traditional farming methods were increasingly inadequate in the face of climate variability. Pioneering work by FAO and other international organizations laid the groundwork for CSA by highlighting the need for practices that simultaneously address productivity, adaptation, and mitigation. The core CSA practices identified in global literature include conservation agriculture, integrated pest management, agroforestry, and the use of climate-resilient crop varieties. CSA in the Indian Context India’s agricultural sector is characterized by small and marginal farms, which account for more than 85% of the country's agricultural holdings. The vulnerability of these farmers to climate change is heightened by their limited access to resources, technology, and information. As a result, the Indian government, along with international and non-governmental organizations, has actively promoted CSA as a means to enhance the resilience of Indian agriculture. Several government initiatives have been pivotal in the promotion of CSA in India. The National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), launched as part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), is a key policy framework aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture through climate-resilient practices. The NMSA focuses on soil health management, efficient water use, and the promotion of drought-tolerant crop varieties. Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) aims to enhance irrigation efficiency, thereby reducing the vulnerability of agriculture to erratic rainfall patterns. Madrewar, Dhinwa, Sah, Bhosale, Gumphekar 744 Key CSA Practices and Their Impacts Numerous studies have documented the positive impacts of CSA practices on agricultural productivity and sustainability in India. Conservation agriculture, which involves minimal soil disturbance, crop rotation, and the use of cover crops, has been shown to improve soil health and increase crop yields. A study by Jat et al. (2020) demonstrated that conservation agriculture practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains resulted in a 15-20% increase in wheat and rice yields, along with a significant reduction in water use. Agroforestry, the integration of trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes, is another CSA practice with substantial benefits. The inclusion of trees on farms has been found to enhance biodiversity, improve soil fertility, and provide additional sources of income for farmers. Research by Pandey et al. (2019) indicated that agroforestry systems in semi-arid regions of India increased crop", "meta": {"title": "Climate-Smart Agriculture: Strategies for Resilient Farming Systems", "org": "IJRA", "year": "2022", "file": "Evaluating Climate-Smart Agriculture Effects on Productivity, Sustainability and Farmer Resilience in India IJIR.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Agroforestry, the integration of trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes, is another CSA practice with substantial benefits. The inclusion of trees on farms has been found to enhance biodiversity, improve soil fertility, and provide additional sources of income for farmers. Research by Pandey et al. (2019) indicated that agroforestry systems in semi-arid regions of India increased crop yields by 10-15% and provided ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and soil erosion control. Improved crop varieties, particularly those that are drought-tolerant or have shorter growing seasons, are essential in regions prone to climate variability. The adoption of such varieties has been supported by initiatives like the NMSA and state-level agricultural extension programs. Studies, including those by Singh and Gupta (2021), have shown that the use of drought-resistant varieties can increase yields by 20-30% under drought conditions, contributing significantly to food security in vulnerable regions. Water-efficient irrigation systems, such as drip and sprinkler irrigation, have gained popularity as a means to conserve water and improve crop productivity. The PMKSY has been instrumental in promoting these technologies, with evidence from various studies (e.g., Kumar and Rao, 2020) showing that drip irrigation can increase water use efficiency by 50-70% and boost crop yields by up to 30%. Challenges in the Adoption of CSA Practices Despite the documented benefits of CSA, its adoption in India faces several challenges. Financial constraints are a significant barrier, particularly for small and marginal farmers who may lack the capital required to invest in new technologies or practices. While government schemes provide some financial support, the coverage and amount are often insufficient to meet the needs of all eligible farmers. Access to technology and knowledge is another critical challenge. The dissemination of CSA practices relies heavily on extension services, which are often under-resourced and unable to reach all farmers, particularly those in remote areas. A study by Sharma et al. (2022) highlighted the gap between awareness and adoption of CSA practices, noting that while 70% of surveyed farmers were aware of at least one CSA practice, only 40% had actually implemented any such practice on their farms. Moreover, the heterogeneity of India’s agro-ecological zones means that CSA practices cannot be uniformly applied across the country. What works in one region may not be suitable for another due to differences in climate, soil type, and water availability. This necessitates a localized approach to CSA, tailored to the specific conditions and needs of each region. International Journal of Integrative Research (IJIR) Vol.2, No.9, 2024: 741-760 745 Role of Stakeholders in Promoting CSA The promotion of CSA in India involves a diverse range of stakeholders, including government agencies, research institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector. Government initiatives such as the NMSA and PMKSY have been central to advancing CSA, but their success depends on effective implementation and collaboration with other stakeholders. Research institutions play a critical role in developing and disseminating CSA practices. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and various state agricultural universities have been instrumental in breeding climate- resilient crop varieties, developing conservation agriculture techniques, and promoting agroforestry. NGOs and community-based organizations have been key in mobilizing farmers and facilitating the adoption of CSA practices at the grassroots level. These organizations often work in partnership with government agencies and research institutions to provide training, distribute resources, and support farmers in implementing CSA. The private sector, particularly agribusinesses, also has a significant role in promoting CSA. Companies involved in the production and distribution of seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation equipment are increasingly recognizing the importance of CSA and are developing products and services tailored to the needs of climate-resilient agriculture. Conclusion of the Literature Review The literature on CSA in India underscores its potential to transform agriculture by making it more resilient, productive, and sustainable in the face of climate change. However, the successful adoption of CSA practices requires overcoming significant challenges related to finance, technology access, and regional variability. Collaborative efforts among government agencies, research institutions, NGOs, and the private sector are essential to scale up CSA and ensure its benefits reach all farmers, particularly the most vulnerable. As climate change continues to impact agriculture, the role of CSA will become increasingly critical.

Instead of depending on wild growth, it was realized that the planting of seeds or cuttings allowed the propagation of the type of plants desired. Another important breakthrough resulted from the need to protect the domesticated plants from abiotic and biotic stress factors. Protected cultivation emerged as a way to protect crops from adverse weather conditions allowing year-round production and the application of an integrated crop production and protection management approach for better control over pests and diseases. Greenhouse crop production is now a growing reality throughout the world with an estimated 405 000 ha of greenhouses spread over all the continents. The degree of sophistication and technology depends on local climatic conditions and the socio-economic environment. The experience of greenhouse production, which emerged in northern Europe, stimulated development in other areas, including the Mediterranean, North America, Oceania, Asia and Africa, with various rates and degrees of success. It has been shown that a mere transposition of north European solutions to other parts of the world is not a valid process. Each environment requires further research, development, extension, training and new norms of application to meet local requirements. During the last 20 years countries in the Mediterranean climate area have become increasingly competitive producers of greenhouse vegetables. During this time there has been a revolution in greenhouse production technology in terms of greenhouse design, type and quality of the plastic covering material, fertigation, mulch, use of high-yielding hybrids and cultivars, plant training and pruning techniques, integrated pest management, the use of pollinator insects, climate control, soil solarization etc. Only a few years ago, a yield of 100 tonnes per hectare of tomato in a greenhouse was considered a good performance. Today, for growers in Mediterranean climate areas, a harvest of 300 tonnes per hectare is not unusual. Besides supplying the local markets, the production of greenhouse vegetables is greatly valued for its export potential and plays an important role in the foreign trade balance of several national economies in the Mediterranean region. However, the intensification of greenhouse crop production has created favourable conditions for many devastating pests and diseases. This has significantly increased the need for pesticide applications. At the same time, legislative measures and standards requirements regarding the quality and safety of vegetables have become viii increasingly demanding. Consumer awareness has risen and the demand for pesticide-free products is a reality which cannot be ignored. Since 1993, the Regional Working Group on Greenhouse Crops in the Mediterranean Region facilitated by the FAO’s Plant Production and Protection Division has supported training and research and development initiatives to strengthen national capacities in upgrading the greenhouse crop sector in Mediterranean climate areas. This publication builds on experience gained through partnerships forged by the working group and represents the interpartner effort of two decades. It aims to summarize the knowledge and practical experiences of scientists from the Near East and North Africa region, specifically from Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Turkey and in collaboration with the Commission of Protected Cultivation of the International Society for Horticulture Science (ISHS) and a worldwide panel of subject matter specialists. This technical document intends to illustrate the benefits that can be drawn from an “integrated production and protection” (IPP) approach linking production technologies and plant protection practices to minimize the use of pesticides and adopting “sustainable intensification” of greenhouse crop production as the guiding principle. It is in line with the new FAO “Save and Grow” paradigm that helps to limit agriculture’s impact on climate change and strengthens resilience of open-field and greenhouse farming systems to socio-economic and climate risks.

By sharing their knowledge and experience, the authors of this publication wish to sustain the competitiveness of the vegetable greenhouse sector in the Mediterranean climate areas and contribute to its further development to the benefit of growers, consumers and the environment. This publication discusses the principles of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) as they may be applied to greenhouse farming in the Mediterranean climate areas. It illustrates different aspects of greenhouse crop production and protection with special emphasis on greenhouse technologies, design and climate control, cropping systems, in particular those practices which help reduce pests and diseases incidence in crops, integrated pest management, the use of adapted cultivars, and the need for traceability and product labelling. ix The guidebook is expected to serve as a training guide for trainers and a resource document for advanced growers and stakeholders of the greenhouse vegetable value chain. It is also a valuable source of information for programme managers, international and multilateral development organizations, NGOs and the private sector – as well as researchers, advisors and professionals in greenhouse agriculture. We trust that it will help to further strengthen the work of the FAO-facilitated Regional Working Group on Greenhouse crops in the Mediterranean Region.

Regional Working Group on Greenhouse Crop Production in the Mediterranean Region: History and development Andreas Papasolomontos, Wilfried Baudoin and NeBambi Lutaladio Plant Production and Protection Division Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy FAO’S PLANT PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION DIVISION (AGP): APPROACH AND ROLE IN PROMOTING REGIONAL COOPERATION IN SUPPORT OF GREENHOUSE CROP PROTECTION In line with the “Save and Grow” concept, AGP works to strengthen global food security by promoting sustainable crop production intensification, which aims at producing more from the same area of land while conserving resources, reducing negative impacts on the environment and enhancing natural capital and the flow of ecosystem services. AGP’s mandate is to enhance and strengthen: • effective and strategic decisions that increase crop production using an ecosystem approach and nutrition-sensitive crop diversification; • national capacities to monitor and respond effectively to transboundary and other important outbreaks of pests; • policies and technologies appropriate to needs of member countries to reduce the negative impact of pesticides; and • conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources with strong linkages between conservation, plant breeding and seed sector development. As part of its programme areas, AGP supports the development of greenhouse technology for horticulture and high-value crops as a means for sustainable crop intensification. To this effect, a Regional Working Group was created 20 years ago, in 1993, to enhance south-south cooperation among the national institutions GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 2 and scientists from Near East and North Africa (NENA) countries 1 and to facilitate interactions with cooperating scientists and institutions from northern countries, such as Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain.2 Together, they formed a network to enhance intercountry cooperation for the improvement of greenhouse crop production technology in the Mediterranean region. In these countries, protected cultivation is continuously expanding leading to improved water-use efficiency, increased productivity per unit input and land, improved product quality, reduced use of pesticides as a result of integrated pest and disease control. Simple tunnel-type greenhouses and more sophisticated structures are evolving side by side depending on the cost-effectiveness. Plastic film is the predominant covering material in Mediterranean climate areas. Out of an estimated 220 000 ha of greenhouses in the Mediterranean countries, 90 percent are covered with plastic and 10 percent with glass.3 The Working Group has been focusing its activities in three main areas: • Information management and dissemination • Training and demonstration • Project formulation and implementation SCOPE OF THIS PUBLICATION AND MAIN OBJECTIVES The publication of Good agricultural practices for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas is a major achievement and also a key milestone of the FAO Regional Working Group on Greenhouse Production in the Mediterranean Region.

Regional Working Group on Greenhouse Crop Production in the Mediterranean Region 3 The document is in line with the new FAO “Save and Grow” paradigm that advocates the sustainable intensification of farming systems and strengthens their resilience to socio-economic and climate risks. The publication is meant to be a reference document for scientists, teachers and students, as well as private sector entrepreneurs. It is proposed as a training support document for upgrading the technical know-how of trainers and pilot growers as well as other actors in the greenhouse vegetables value chain in Mediterranean climate areas. ORIGIN AND OPERATIONAL MODALITIES OF THE GREENHOUSE REGIONAL WORKING GROUP The premises leading to the establishment of the FAO Working Group in the Mediterranean Region date back to February 1984. On the occasion of the ISHS Symposium on “Plastics for Horticulture in the Mediterranean Region” in Hammamet, Tunisia, the decision was made to prepare a position paper on the greenhouse production technology in the Mediterranean region based on the contributions of selected collaborators. In September 1984, following a meeting with the Faculty of Horticulture at the State University of Gembloux, Belgium, an agreement was reached on the content and authors of a position paper entitled “Intensification of Horticulture Crop Production under Protected Cultivation in the Mediterranean Region”. In June 1985 the members of the drafting committee met in Gembloux to review the first draft under the joint supervision of Professor André Nisen, Faculty of Horticulture, Gembloux and Professor Giuseppe Lamalfa, University of Catania, Italy. The advanced draft was discussed in December 1985 during the ISHS workshop on “Protected Cultivation of Solanaceae Crops” in Faro, Portugal. The document was finally published in 1988 as the FAO AGP Technical Paper No. 90, initially in English and subsequently translated into French, Spanish and Arabic. The actual establishment of the FAO Working Group on Greenhouse Crop Production in the Mediterranean Region, referred to as the WG, emerged from the recommendation formulated by the participants at the Expert Consultation Meeting on Protected Cultivation convened by Dr Abderahmane Hilali, Director of the Complexe Horticole (Institut Hassan II) in Agadir, Morocco in November 1993. The WG group is composed of scientists and decision-makers representing 12 countries from the Near East and North Africa region, namely Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Turkey. As a result of a consultation process, the group members agreed on the scope, objectives and operational modalities for the WG. Realizing the complexity and the interaction of different disciplines for successful greenhouse crop management, they recommended that the scope of the WG should be to promote an “integrated approach” for sustainable greenhouse crop production intensification aiming at GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 4 improved product quality and safety with a view to reducing the use of pesticides and applying alternative methods for pest and disease control.

The concept of integrated production and protection (IPP) was officially introduced by the WG – as a precursor of the GAP concept – on occasion of the International Symposium on Integrated Production and Protection of Horticultural Crops, convened by Dr Abdelhaq Hanafi (then Professor at Complexe Horticole of IAV Hassan) in Agadir, Morocco, in May 1997. The WG members adopted the following three types of interrelated activities for the programme of the WG: • Assessment of greenhouse production technologies for transfer to growers • Strengthening of capacity building • Implementation of joint research and development initiatives The disciplines to be covered were grouped in four thematic areas (TA), each animated by a technical coordinator (TC). The activities in the four thematic areas were grouped into three categories: • Information exchange • Training and field demonstrations • Project formulation and implementation From an operational point of view, the WG activities are facilitated by a WG coordinator, belonging to one of the participating countries and with an office term of 2 years. The WG programme is discussed at the WG coordinating meeting held every 2 years to review the progress and achievements in the past biennium, agree on a work plan for the coming biennium and elect the WG coordinator. Most of the activities are implemented by countries drawing on their own resources or with project support. The coordinating meeting is hosted by the country of the “incoming” regional coordinator elected at the previous coordinating meeting. Disciplines covered • TA1: Irrigation, fertigation, soilless culture (TC: Ayman Abou Hadid, Egypt) • TA2: Greenhouse design, covering materials, climate control, including geothermal water use (TC: Abdelaziz Mougou, Tunisia) • TA3: IPP: Integrated production and protection management (TC: Abdelhaq Hanafi, Saudi Arabia) • TA4: Production economics, quality requirements, crop diversification, organic horticulture (TC: Yuksel Tuzel, Turkey) 1. Regional Working Group on Greenhouse Crop Production in the Mediterranean Region 5 ACTIVITIES, RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE WORKING GROUP Capacity building has been pursued through a series of FAO-sponsored technical workshops. As a group, the network members play a leading role in promoting the exchange of information on greenhouse crop technology and have been able to organize several international symposia, often in conjunction with the Commission Protected Cultivation of the International Society for Horticulture Science: • Integrated production and protection (IPP) of horticulture crops, Agadir Morocco, 6–9 May 1997 • Strategies towards sustainability of protected cultivation in mild winter climate, Antalya, Turkey, 3–5 Nov. 1997 • Growing media and hydroponics, Thessaloniki, Greece, 4–5 Sept. 1999 • Greenhouse floriculture, production and export of cutflowers, Tunis, Tunisia, 9–10 June 2000 • Greenhouse vegetable production standards for quality and safety, Beirut, Lebanon, 6–7 May 2001 • Vegetable breeding and seed production, Cairo, Egypt, 12–16 Dec. 2001 • Organic greenhouse vegetable production, Amman, Jordan, 28–29 Jan. 2002 • Protected cultivation in mild winter climate: product and process innovation, Ragusa, Italy, 5–8 Mar. 2002 • Flowers for the future, Izmir, Turkey, 7–11 Oct. 2002 • Integrated greenhouse production and protection (IGPP), Beirut, Lebanon, 8–9 Mar. 2003 • Soilless culture technologies, Izmir, Turkey, 5–6 Mar. 2004 • Greenhouse cooling, Almería, Spain, 23–24 May 2006 • Sustainable greenhouse crop production technologies in mild winter climates, Antalya, Turkey, 6–11 April 2008 Exchange of information has been facilitated through the publication of technical documents and proceedings of workshops and symposia, which have been posted on the WG Web site http://www.NenaGreenhousesFao.org.

Both SCIS and GRIS have been integrated into Hortivar. Research for development has been strengthened and transfer of know- how to growers has been facilitated through the formulation and implementation of field projects. The WG, with the assistance of FAO, has been able to formulate research- development projects and has obtained funding from EU, UNDP and TCP. The FAO regional project, TCP/INT/0165 established demonstration and training greenhouses in each of the participating countries. The objective of the project was to prepare growers to join GAP schemes like GLOBALG.A.P. by demonstrating and providing training for the adoption of integrated production and protection management (IPP) in greenhouse crops, aiming at healthy and high quality produce, sustainable productivity and reduced use of pesticides. EU-funded ECOPONICS project, “Efficient water use through environmentally sound hydroponic production of high quality vegetables for domestic and export markets in Mediterranean countries” (2002–06). The project investigated simplified, economical and water-use-efficient hydroponics systems. Under the scientific coordination of the Technical University of Munich, it demonstrated the economic feasibility of ECOPONICS technology for vegetable enterprise development in Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Morocco. It produced a set of tools – “standard operation practices” (SOPs) – for farmers, technicians and extension specialists, highlighting the advantages in relation to water management, salinity and product quality compared with traditional cultivation practices for export and domestic markets TCP/TUN/8823. The project succeeded in demonstrating the potential of flower diversification options in order to capture export market niches and to supply the local market demand. Cost-benefit studies have been carried out to establish the comparative advantage of specific flower crops and farmers have been trained in applying improved and intensified cultivation practices. 4 Hortivar: FAO’s database on the performances of horticulture cultivars and platform for access to and sharing of information on the horticulture sector in general. 1. Regional Working Group on Greenhouse Crop Production in the Mediterranean Region 7 TCP/LEB/0067 (phase I) followed by TCP/LEB/2906 (phase II) “Rehabilitation of greenhouse vegetable production standards for safety and quality”. The overall objective is to restore small-scale farmers’ capability to produce high quality and safe vegetables under protected cultivation. The immediate objective of the project was to demonstrate “in field” cropping seasons by in situ demonstrations of improved production technologies and cultivation practices aimed at increasing vegetable yields and product safety and quality, lowering production costs, adopting more efficient greenhouse design and avoiding the disadvantages of the traditional greenhouse. UNDP/EGY/95/002 “Protected cultivation”. The objectives of the agriculture strategy in Egypt are to increase agricultural productivity per unit of land and water through more efficient use of limited resources, reduction in the cost of production and thereby increase in the national output and farmers’ incomes. To fulfil these objectives, the project was designed to support the development and adoption of new technologies. Protected cultivation and soilless culture were recognized as efficient and promising technologies for attaining the set objectives. CAPITALIZATION On occasion of the Sixth WG Coordinating Meeting, held in Amman, Jordan in December 2006, the participants considered that the time was appropriate to take stock of the information accumulated and the experiences gained since the publication of the FAO AGP Technical Paper No. 90. They recommended that FAO take the lead in compiling a multi-author technical document which would serve the double purpose of compiling the know-how gained and making it available to growers and stakeholders in the greenhouse crop sector in the NENA region with a view to sustaining its competitiveness.

The overall guidelines and the identification of potential authors for the drafting of a publication on “Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas” were elaborated on occasion of an FAO-ISHS workshop, which took place in June 2009 at the International Symposium on High Technology for Greenhouse Systems, Greensys 2009, hosted by the University of Laval, Quebec, Canada. Subsequently, an expert meeting was convened in Amman, Jordan in May 2010, which brought together the lead authors and allowed to discuss further the scope and target audience of the publication and to elaborate the table of contents. The members of the drafting committee met in Lisbon in August 2010 on occasion of the International Horticulture Congress to discuss and review the progress on the drafting of the document followed by a second business meeting in June 2011 on occasion of the Greensys Symposium in Halkidiki, Greece. Editing took place during 2012. The final draft version was shared with the authors and participants at the International Workshop on “Good Agriculture GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 8 Practices – GAP – for greenhouse crops in the Mediterranean region”, jointly convened by ISHS, NCARE and FAO from 9 to 12 December 2012 in Jordan. Early 2013 allowed for a final peer review, proofreading and printing. THE WAY FORWARD The activities of the FAO Regional Working Group on Greenhouse Crop Production in the Mediterranean Region has undoubtedly impacted on the improvement of the greenhouse production sector in the NENA countries and has contributed to its mutation from a somewhat empiric activity into a professional enterprise with scientific bases. The WG members are committed to continuing their cooperation and determined to seek opportunities to jointly implement research and development projects of common interest in support of the greenhouse crop sector in the Mediterranean climate areas. As a network of scientists, they will pursue their interaction with FAO and serve as a resource for information exchange, training and capitalization of know-how.

Greenhouse site selection Nicolás Castilla and Esteban Baeza Institute for Agricultural Research and Training (IFAPA), Granada, Spain INTRODUCTION In recent decades, greenhouse area has risen worldwide, due mainly to the increased use of plastic greenhouses for growing vegetable crops. Site selection is a key factor for profitable and sustainable greenhouse production. The main factors determining location and site selection of a greenhouse production area are: cost of production, quality of produced yield, and transportation cost to markets (Nelson, 1985; Castilla, 2007). Obviously, cost and quality of production depend on the local climate and the greenhouse growing conditions. The level of investment in technology (simple or sophisticated greenhouses and equipment), as well as management, depends primarily on the local climate. Nowadays, long distance transportation means that production areas may be located far from major consumption centres, enabling the development of greenhouse industries in many climatically favourable areas around the world, such as the coastal zones of the Mediterranean Basin (Plate 1). In addition to transportation, marketing (standardization, packing etc.) also affects the overall cost of the products; they tend to be similar for different commodities coming from different geographical origins, but which compete in the same markets (Castilla et al., 2004). This chapter examines the climatic conditions required for the production of greenhouse crops, in particular vegetables. GREENHOUSE MICROCLIMATE MODIFICATION From a historical point of view, the initial objective of greenhouse cultivation was to grow heat-demanding species during the winter season in temperate countries, i.e. countries with a cold winter season. Inside greenhouses more favourable temperatures may be reached during the cold season, thanks to the windbreak effect and the Plate 1 Poniente area (Almería, Spain) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 22 greenhouse effect. During the warm season, especially in the Mediterranean and tropical areas, where there is high solar radiation and the temperature exceeds the recommended maximum threshold level, the greenhouse effect has an adverse impact on the microclimate and crop performance. However, these negative effects are to some extent compensated for by the shading effect and can be regulated to a certain extent by proper ventilation and/or cooling of the greenhouse. The greenhouse effect is the result of two different effects: • a confinement effect, resulting from the decrease in the air exchanges with the outside environment; and • an effect caused by the existence of a cover characterized by its low transparency to far infrared radiation (emitted by the crop, the soil and the inner greenhouse elements), but its high transparency to sunlight. The use of cladding greenhouses with screens (nets) throughout the year, instead of plastic films, has become common practice in recent years in areas of very mild temperature (low latitudes) and in areas where temperatures are very mild in selected periods (medium latitudes in spring and summer). In these “screenhouses”, the greenhouse effect is minimal, as the confinement effect is very limited and sunlight is reduced (as screens’ transparency to sunlight is, normally, lower than in conventional greenhouse plastic cladding films). This minimal greenhouse effect varies according to the characteristics of the screens (permeability for air exchanges with the outside environment and transparency to sunlight), while the shading and windbreak effects prevail. Screenhouses do not protect crops from rainfall, as their cover is permeable, but they can reduce the damage caused by heavy rain and hail. GREENHOUSE PRODUCTION STRATEGIES When planning the installation of a greenhouse, two main questions must be answered (Jensen and Malter, 1995): • Where will the production be marketed (domestic or export markets or both)? • What type of commodities will be produced (edible or ornamentals)? Plate 2 Banana crop in a greenhouse Plate 3 Year-round supply of high-quality products 2. Greenhouse site selection 23 In general, optimum climatic conditions and low production costs (with good quality) are key to the selection of a location; transportation costs are also an important consideration when markets are far away (Castilla, 2007). Other technical and socio-economic aspects (water and electricity supply, labour availability etc.) also influence production costs and competitiveness (Castilla and Hernandez, 2005). There is currently a high demand from consumers for a year-round supply of quality products (Plate 3), conditioning the production strategies in the greenhouse industry. Greenhouse crops in mild winter climates, such as in the Mediterranean area, cannot be grown all year round with high quality.

There is currently a high demand from consumers for a year-round supply of quality products (Plate 3), conditioning the production strategies in the greenhouse industry. Greenhouse crops in mild winter climates, such as in the Mediterranean area, cannot be grown all year round with high quality. The challenge of supplying high quality vegetables all year round can be met by adopting one of two basic strategies: • Growing in high-tech greenhouses, avoiding strong dependence on the outdoor climate. • Growing in two or more locations with complementary harvesting periods, enabling a continuous and coordinated year-round supply to markets (Castilla and Hernandez, 2007). The second alternative (using different locations, usually with different greenhouse technological levels) is an increasingly adopted strategy. In some regions, including the Mediterranean, adapting plants to a suboptimal environment has in the past been the most common production strategy. In contrast, in northern Europe, the favoured approach has been to optimize the greenhouse environment in order to reach maximum potential yields. Nowadays, market globalization has led to greater competitiveness; it is therefore necessary to increase the quality of greenhouse products through better climate control (Castilla and Montero, 2008). CLIMATIC SUITABILITY FOR GREENHOUSE VEGETABLE PRODUCTION Introduction Today’s greenhouse technologies mean it is possible to cultivate all horticultural species in any region of the world, provided that the greenhouse is properly designed and equipped to control the climatic parameters. However, for profitable and sustainable cultivation of the target crop, much stricter selection of the region is necessary, on the basis of climatic conditions and the requirements of the selected horticultural crop. Solar radiation is the main climate parameter needed to evaluate the climate suitability of a region for protected cultivation. Day length and solar radiation intercepted by a horizontal surface during daytime hours are measured to determine total daily solar radiation. Another basic climate parameter is ambient temperature. The stability of both values in different months of the year enables GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 24 the representation of their mean monthly values (obtained by averaging data sets for several years) for a given location in the climate diagram, which represents the location’s climate (Figure 1). Other climate parameters, such as soil temperature (closely linked to air temperature), wind, rainfall and air composition (humidity and CO2), influence to a lesser degree the evaluation of climate suitability. The type of greenhouse adopted depends on the region’s climatic characteristics and on the crop requirements. For example, in a region with a tropical humid climate, where protection from rain is the greenhouse’s main purpose (prevalence of the umbrella effect), the type of construction preferred may be different from that desirable in a semi-desert or Mediterranean climate region (Plate 4). Climatic requirements of vegetables The most commonly grown species in greenhouses are vegetables with medium thermal requirements (tomato, pepper, cucumber, melon, watermelon, marrow, FIGURE 1 Estimation of climate suitability of Almería (Spain, 37ºN) for cultivation of thermophilic vegetable species in greenhouses, from the monthly average values of ambient temperature and solar radiation A Heating required B Protected cultivation possible without climate control but with natural ventilation (passive) C Open air cultivation possible (inland areas) D Open air cultivation possible (coastal areas) E Need to use techniques to decrease temperatures F Excessive temperatures Nisen et al., 1988 (adapted) may mar apr aug jul nov jan dec feb oct sep MJ . m-2 . d-1 A 30 25 20 15 10 8.46 5 0 2 7 12 17 22 27 B C D E F Radiation threshold Solar radiation Average monthly temperature of the air (°C) jun 2.

The indicated species, traditionally grown in the warm season, are adapted to average ambient temperatures ranging from 17 to 28 °C, with limits of 12 ºC (minimum) and 32 ºC (maximum) (Nisen et al., 1988). They are sensitive to the cold and suffer irreversible damage with frosts. Temperatures persistently below 10–12 °C over several days affect productivity, as do temperatures above 30 °C (in the case of dry air) or 30–35 °C (in the case of high air humidity) (Nisen et al., 1988). Daily variation between day and night average temperatures (thermal periodicity) is required for proper physiological functioning. These thermal differences are between 5 and 7 °C (Nisen et al., 1988). The minimum daily radiation requirements of these species are estimated at around 8.5 MJ m-2 day-1 (equivalent to 2.34 kWh m-2 day-1) during the three shortest months of year (November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere; May, June and July in the Southern Hemisphere). This means around 6 hours of light per day, to a minimum total of 500–550 hours of light during these three months (Nisen et al., 1988). The duration of the day and night and, consequently, the total solar radiation depend on the geographical latitude and the time of the year (Table 1). Other desirable climate parameters for these species would be soil temperature of > 14 °C and ambient relative humidity of 70–90% (Nisen et al., 1988).

Therefore, the natural radiation conditions are the main limiting factor to consider when establishing greenhouses. Given the parallelism between air and soil temperatures (even with less oscillation inside a greenhouse than in the open air), achieving a suitable ambient temperature also involves proper soil temperature values. FAO proposed a methodology for achieving the required climate conditions (Nisen et al., 1988). Protected cultivation in greenhouses or high tunnels causes the increase of daytime temperature (in relation to the outside) to very high values (Figure 2), depending on: • characteristics of the cladding material; • outside wind velocity; • incident solar radiation; • transpiration of the crop grown inside the greenhouse. Night temperatures, on the other hand, only increase slightly in relation to the outside (2–4 °C at the most) and, in some cases, are lower (thermal inversion). The maximum temperature increase varies with latitude and, for each specific location, with the time of year as the solar radiation changes (Figure 3). To increase low temperatures, the most common solution is to heat the greenhouse, but this is not always profitable. In some cases, an efficient isolation system can prevent temperature drop at night – as in the “lean-to greenhouse” in FIGURE 3 Indicative representation of the maximum amplitude of the temperature increase (DT max) in a closed greenhouse, well irrigated, at several times of the year and various latitudes 20 10 0 35 °N 40 °N 45 °N DT max (°C) June September March December Latitude Nisen et al., 1988 (adapted) FIGURE 2 Indicative representation of the temperature increase (DT) in a closed greenhouse, well irrigated, as a function of the solar radiation intensity (Rs) and the wind velocity (U) U = 0 m . s-1 U = 10 m . s-1 kcal . m-2 . h-1 W . m-2 Rs DT (°C) 10 0 20 150 150 150 175 525 875 Nisen et al., 1988 (adapted) 2.

Greenhouse site selection 27 China, where a curtain of canes and wood is manually placed over the greenhouse cover at sunset, then removed at sunrise. This solution prevents major temperature decreases at night, but is highly labour- intensive. To limit temperature excesses, the renewal of interior air by means of ventilation is the classic and most economic tool. The hourly air renewal rate needed to keep the temperature gradient at a certain value, depending on maximum predictable solar radiation, can be very high (Figure 4) and impossible to achieve without mechanical ventilation. Climate suitability The fundamental requirements of those thermophilic horticultural species for which there is a high demand for out-of-season cultivation (tomato, pepper, melon, watermelon etc.) are as follows (Nisen et al., 1988): • Minimum global radiation of 8.5 MJ/m2/day (equivalent of 2.34 kWh/m2/ day). • Average ambient temperatures of 17–27 ºC in coastal areas and 17º–22 ºC in inland areas (far from the sea). This distinction is based on the fact that the daily thermal oscillations of inland areas (around 20 ºC) are higher than those of coastal areas (10 ºC) It is not economically viable to actively control the microclimate in unsophisticated greenhouses, and minimum greenhouse temperatures are therefore very similar to those in the open air, especially when there are no heating systems. The maximum temperatures with passive normal ventilation can be around 10 °C higher than outside, involving an increase in the average temperatures of about 5 °C. In the light of these considerations, the thermal climate limits for protected cultivation without active climate control equipment are 12–22 °C in coastal areas and 12–17 °C in inland areas. Outside these limits, protected cultivation requires active climate controlling systems: heating, mechanical ventilation and cooling. Figure 1 represents the climate diagram of Almería. Solar radiation in December is at its minimum. Temperatures are slightly below 12 °C (minimum threshold) in January, and heating is therefore necessary. With the exception of the summer (June, July, August and September), the remaining months present thermal conditions suitable for protected cultivation (12–22 °C) with efficient ventilation. In the summer, thermal excesses must be limited to cultivate inside greenhouses.

Similarly, it is possible to evaluate the climate suitability of a certain location for greenhouse cultivation of other less thermal-demanding species, such as lettuce and Chinese cabbage (Plate 6). The use of screens instead of plastic films as covering material induces a minimal greenhouse effect, generating shading and windbreak effects. Screenhouses are an option for protected cultivation and are becoming more widespread in low-rainfall areas with very mild winter temperatures, and in highlands at medium latitudes during the summer. GREENHOUSE LOCAL SITE The specific selection of a greenhouse location must take into account a variety of factors (Castilla, 2007), described below. Topography In principle, the location must be flat in width direction, with a slope in the main axes between 0 and 0.5 percent, and never over 1–2 percent, as this would require terracing. In some cases, however, a south-oriented inclined plot (in the Northern Hemisphere) may be acceptable if the chosen greenhouse type adapts well; in this case, mechanization is rare (such as on Spain’s south coast, where low-cost greenhouses are common on the coastal slopes – Plate 7).

Microclimate As with liquids, cold air moves downwards (as it is heavier than hot air) to the lower parts of the site, and stays there if there is no wind to carry it away. Therefore, it is essential that the local topography is suitable for effective drainage of cold air during calm nights. Frequently foggy areas should be avoided. Areas that are well illuminated and free from shadows (hills, buildings) are preferred.

Greenhouse site selection 29 Harsh weather conditions Sites should be protected from cold winds (usually from the north in the Northern Hemisphere), using windbreaks or taking advantage of the topography. If snow is to be expected, greenhouses must be positioned sufficiently far from trees or other obstacles to the wind, since snow may accumulate around such obstacles. Irrigation It should be emphasized that the availability of water (in sufficient quantity and of good quality) is an essential requirement for greenhouse growing of high added value crops. Many areas have been abandoned due to the lack of water in sufficient quantities and of acceptable quality (salinity) in the Mediterranean Basin. Drainage The drainage conditions must be good, especially in regions of high rainfall. Places with a high water table must be avoided. Soil characteristics Whether cultivation is directly in the soil or in pots or containers, the soil must have properties appropriate for horticultural crops. Pollution For greenhouses located in urban areas, air pollution conditions must be evaluated, not only in terms of incidence on the plants themselves, but also with regard to residues deposited on the greenhouse, which can limit solar radiation (e.g. dust from factories) or damage the greenhouse cladding material. Availability of space Space may be required for future enlargement, auxiliary facilities (e.g. water basins for collection of rainfall water or storage of irrigation water) and buildings (e.g. handling, stores, offices). Availability of labour If local labour is not available, it is necessary to consider the costs inherent in acquiring labour. Infrastructures Proximity to transport networks (e.g. roads, railway), access to communication systems (e.g. telephone, internet) and availability of energy (e.g. gas, electricity) must all be considered. Orientation The position must be chosen to avoid shadows from hills or neighbouring buildings. It is necessary to adapt the shape and slope of the roof to dominant winds, while maintaining the objective of maximum light in the greenhouse. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 30 GAP recommendations Site selection: • Production costs and yield quality are key factors when choosing the greenhouse site; they depend mainly on climate conditions determining the greenhouse microclimate. • Transportation costs are a crucial factor, although greenhouse production has expanded to areas far from destination markets, thanks to improvements in communications and logistics. Climate conditions: Profitable and sustainable cultivation of the target crop requires strict selection of the region, on the basis of its climate conditions and the requirements of the selected horticultural crop, noting the following considerations: • Solar radiation (and its year-round availability) and air temperature are the two main climate parameters to evaluate. • In cold and mild winter climate areas, the greenhouse effect prevails and the main objective is temperature increase. • In tropical and subtropical areas, the windbreak effect (protection from strong winds), the umbrella effect (protection from heavy rains) and the shading effect (protection from high radiation) prevail. • In arid and semi-arid regions, the oasis effect (raising air humidity and limiting high temperatures in a well-watered crop) prevails: there is increasingly widespread use of screens instead of plastic films as cladding material.

Greenhouse site selection 31 GAP recommendations (cont.) Region selection on the basis of climate conditions and crop requirements: • Solar radiation is the first climate parameter to be evaluated, in particular year-round availability. • Other important parameters are soil temperature (linked to air temperature) and, to a lesser extent, wind, rainfall and air composition (humidity and CO2). • The most commonly grown species in Mediterranean greenhouses are vegetables with medium thermal requirements (tomato, pepper, cucumber, melon, watermelon, marrow, green bean, eggplant etc.). • Suitable species are warm season crops, adapted to average ambient temperatures ranging from 17 to 28 °C, and with limits of 12 °C (minimum) and 32 °C (maximum) (Nisen et al., 1988). They are sensitive to the cold and suffer irreversible damage with frosts. • Minimum daily radiation requirements of these species are estimated at around 6 hours of light per day, totalling a minimum of 500–550 hours of light during the 3 shortest months of the year (November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere; May, June and July in the Southern Hemisphere). • Unless there is an imperious need (and very high selling prices), greenhouse production is not recommended in geographical areas with unsuitable climate conditions requiring notable and expensive artificial climate control. • Given the impossibility of increasing, at a reasonable cost, natural radiation conditions (except in very sophisticated greenhouses and with high-value crops), greenhouse design and location must optimize the interception of solar radiation during autumn and winter. • To raise low temperatures, the most common solution is to heat the greenhouse, but this is not always profitable. In some cases, a highly isolating system can avoid temperature drop at night (e.g. “lean-to greenhouses” in China). • To avoid excessively high temperatures, the traditional and most economically viable method is the renewal of interior air by means of ventilation. • Other important parameters for climate suitability are soil temperature (linked to air temperature) and to a lesser degree, wind, rainfall and air composition (humidity and carbon dioxide, CO2). There are some differences between air temperature and plant temperature and also between parts of the plant, especially during daytime, depending on the radiation intercepted, the water transpiration and the air movement. The root temperature is assumed to be the same as the soil temperature. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 32 CONCLUSIONS Site selection is crucial for profitable and sustainable greenhouse production. The climate influences the type and level of greenhouse technology (structure and internal equipment for climate control) and subsequent crop production conditions, which in turn influence product cost and quality. The distance to markets, especially in export-focused production, can be a limiting factor for profitable greenhouse cultivation. An economic compromise between the investment costs of the greenhouses and equipment and their agricultural performance is necessary to produce proper quality commodities at a competitive level.

As energy prices rose, the greenhouse surface area remained stable or decreased in countries with low winter temperatures, while it increased significantly in areas where heating requirements were much lower. Mediterranean horticulture benefited from the availability of abundant autumn and winter light and from the mild winter conditions resulting from the proximity of the growing areas to the sea (Castilla and Hernández, 2005). The energy scenario led to the establishment of two distinct production models (Figure 1): • Cold countries adopted advanced greenhouse technology, increased light transmission, saved energy for heating and optimized all production means to achieve maximum yield; they used glass as covering material. • Southern or Mediterranean greenhouses adapted to the local conditions, with moderate investments and little (if any) climate control system besides natural ventilation; this produced suboptimal conditions for plant production and as a consequence lower yields than high-tech greenhouses; they used mostly plastic film as covering material (Castilla, 2005). This chapter discusses the most relevant issues related to greenhouse design and covering materials for good agricultural practices (GAP) in Mediterranean areas. Four main areas are dealt with: greenhouse types, plastic films as covering materials, insect-proof screens and greenhouse natural ventilation. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 36 MAIN GREENHOUSE TYPES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN Local-type greenhouses These greenhouse types are normally very low-cost structures with little climate control besides natural ventilation; they are built with local materials (i.e. wood) and covered with polyethylene plastic film. The parral-type greenhouse is probably the most widely used in terms of surface area. In Almería (Spain) alone it covers approximately 27 000 ha (EFSA, 2009). The parral greenhouse is made of a vertical structure of rigid pillars (wood or steel) on which a double grid of wire is placed to attach the plastic film. As in other parts of the Mediterranean, the cost of materials obtained locally and the availability of installation expertise have been fundamental for greenhouse expansion. Local-type greenhouses require a relatively low level of investment, making them suitable for farms operated by small growers.

Greenhouse design and covering materials 37 • low ventilator surface area, due to a poor combination of side and roof ventilation and to the construction of excessively small roof vents, resulting from the grower’s fear of sudden strong winds that may damage the ventilators. • inefficient ventilator designs – for roof ventilation, flap ventilation is always preferable to rolling ventilators as it provides higher ventilator rates (almost three times greater airflow according to Pérez-Parra et al. [2004]). • use of low porosity insect screens – insect-proof screens strongly reduce the air exchange rate. Good agricultural practices require good ventilation and light transmission. The lack of good ventilation in most local-type greenhouses can be compensated for by improved design of the ventilation systems. Light transmission depends on the properties of the covering material and the number of opaque supporting members, as well as the greenhouse geometry and orientation. In terms of roof slope, computer simulations show that during the winter, increasing the roof slope from 11 to 45° can increase daily light transmission by nearly 10 percent, since losses due to reflection are reduced. In practice, it is more useful to find a compromise between good light transmission and construction costs, and most new greenhouses have a roof slope of 25–30°. With regard to greenhouse orientation, there are two main factors that have to be balanced before choosing the best solution: light transmission and ventilation. At Mediterranean latitudes (37°N), for greenhouses with a 10° roof slope, east to west (E–W) orientation has better transmission than north to south (N–S) during winter, while it has lower transmission in the summer; however, the differences are small (Figure 3a). For greenhouses with a 30° roof slope, the E–W greenhouse transmits approximately 13 percent more than the N–S greenhouse during the winter period (Figure 3b). Therefore, in terms of light transmission, it is recommended to build the greenhouse with an E–W orientation. Nevertheless, light uniformity is better in N–S greenhouses since the gutter and ridge shadows change their position during the day as the sun moves. In some Mediterranean areas, greenhouses are E–W oriented, but the crop rows are N–S for greater crop uniformity. With regard to ventilation, it is advisable to build the roof ventilators perpendicular to the prevailing winds to enhance the air exchange. FIGURE 2 Scheme of light transmission in winter for two greenhouse roof slopes Castilla, 2005 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 38 Plastic-covered industrial-type greenhouses A large number of different greenhouse structures may be included in this group (pitched roof multi-span, asymmetric multi-span, saw-tooth, curved roof multi- span etc.). The arch-shaped multi-span system prevails among the industrial types, mostly clad with plastic film or, in some cases, with rigid or semi-rigid materials (preferably polycarbonate). The roof is often covered with plastic film, while the side and front walls are covered with semi-rigid plastics. These arch-shaped multi- span structures are normally made of galvanized steel and are preferred by the ornamental growers and nurseries. Multi-span structures are tighter than parral- type greenhouses and easier to equip with cooling, heating and/or computer control; such structures are very common in Israel. In general, this group includes greenhouses with more efficient ventilation systems: the roof vents are usually larger than in the handmade greenhouses with FIGURE 3 Direct radiation transmission for greenhouses with the main axis north-south and east-west, latitude 37 ºnorth a) roof slope 10° b) roof slope 30° Castilla, 2005 Direct radiation transmission % 21 Dec.", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

In general, this group includes greenhouses with more efficient ventilation systems: the roof vents are usually larger than in the handmade greenhouses with FIGURE 3 Direct radiation transmission for greenhouses with the main axis north-south and east-west, latitude 37 ºnorth a) roof slope 10° b) roof slope 30° Castilla, 2005 Direct radiation transmission % 21 Dec. 21 Feb. 21 April 21 June N-S E-W 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 Direct radiation transmission % 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 E-W N-S 21 June 21 April 21 Feb. 21 Dec.

Greenhouse design and covering materials 39 at least one roof vent per span (double roof vents per span can also be found). In some cases, these structures may also have combined roof and sidewall ventilation. Sometimes roof ventilators are in an alternating mode facing one direction and the opposite direction, but there is no scientific evidence that this arrangement adds any advantage. While arch-shaped multi-span greenhouses have many advantages, they are not free from problems. Condensation can occur in the upper inner part of the roof, resulting in dripping in humid and cold weather, usually during the early hours of the day. Attempts have been made to solve this problem by increasing the roof slope with pointed arches instead of circular, but this has not entirely eliminated the condensation. Glasshouses Glasshouses are the most commonly found greenhouse structures in cold parts of the Northern Hemisphere. They are usually built in very large compartments in order to lower cost per unit area, improve efficiency and reduce heat loss through the sidewalls; in the Netherlands the average glasshouse area was 1.5 ha in 2003 (Bunschoten and Pierik, 2003). They usually have only roof ventilators, which may be discontinuous (e.g. Venlo type, one-side mounted windows) or continuous. The relation between the ventilator area and the greenhouse covered area is often around 25 percent, which is close to the ASABE standards (ASABE, 1999). The glasshouse area in southern European countries is limited, mainly because of the high investment costs. Glasshouses occupy less than 1 percent of the total greenhouse area in countries such as Spain. If glasshouses are to be constructed in climate areas warmer than northern Europe, ventilation must be improved. The combination of roof and sidewall ventilation ensures higher ventilation rates, both in windy conditions (Kacira et al., 2004a) and in low or zero wind conditions with buoyancy-driven natural ventilation (Baeza et al., 2009). Plate 3 Venlo-type glasshouses GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 40 PLASTIC FILMS AS GREENHOUSE COVERING MATERIAL A covering material is chosen for its optical and mechanical properties and on the basis of climate and location (Waaijenberg and Sonneveld, 2004). Good agricultural practices dictate that greenhouse plastic should have maximum solar transmission (so dust washes away easily and does not stick) and be opaque to long-wave radiation to reduce heat loss at night. Greenhouse films are composed of polymers and additives. Polymers are the basic component, while additives provide a variety of different properties including infrared absorption/reflection and light diffusion. Greenhouse cladding films range in thickness from 80 to 200 µm. Film width is up to 20 m. Single layer or multilayer (typically three-layer) films are widely used in commercial production, but multilayer films are preferred as they combine the positive properties of their individual components (e.g. good mechanical resistance and good light transmission). The life span of greenhouse films has increased from 9 months during the 1950s to approximately 45 months today. Weathering depends on the photo-additives incorporated in the film as well as on the geographic location and the exposure of the film to pesticide treatments (Cepla, 2006). Polymers and additives Polymers are large molecules formed by the association of smaller units called monomers.

Their main advantage is their low investment cost; their principal disadvantage is the lack of climate control (mainly lack of ventilation). • Avoid low roof slope greenhouses for better light transmission. • If ventilation is of greater concern than light transmission, orient the greenhouse so that the vents are open towards the prevailing winds. • Choose E–W orientation if there is no conflict with ventilation. • Crop rows must be N–S for optimum light uniformity. • Industrial-type plastic-covered greenhouses can modulate unfavourable external conditions. While recommended over the local-type greenhouses, their cost-benefit analysis could be worse than for local-type greenhouses in the short term. • Glasshouses are excellent greenhouse structures, but they are not popular in southern European countries, mainly because of the high investment costs. 3. Greenhouse design and covering materials 41 (EBA). These three polymers cover more than 80 percent of the world market. Other materials are also popular, such as PVC in Japan or linear low density polyethylene (LLDP) in the rest of the world. In comparison with glass, a property common to all plastic materials is their low density and therefore low weight (Table 1). The low density and thickness of plastic materials is a great advantage in horticulture since it facilitates transportation, handling and installation. For example, 1 m2 of LDPE film 200 µm thick weighs approximately 184 g; the same film made of PVC weighs about 260 g; while a glass pane 4 mm thick weighs 10 kg. The light weight and flexibility of the covering material allows a significant reduction in the size and number of the supporting members, making the greenhouse frame lighter compared with the glasshouse frame, and thus much cheaper. Additives are an essential part of the covering materials. They are dispersed between the chains of polymer molecules without interacting chemically. Additives are used to facilitate the manufacturing of the film as well as to improve its performance under field conditions; the type and quantity of additive depends on which properties of the covering material need improving. The two most common additives in horticulture are UV (ultraviolet) stabilizer additives and IR (infrared) absorbing additives. UV stabilizers absorb UV radiation or protect the polymer molecules. As a consequence, the film ages more slowly: indeed, the vast majority of plastic films in horticulture last more than one year and include UV stabilizer additives. Good greenhouse film should block long-wave IR radiation (wavelength 0.7–4 µm) so as to reduce heat loss. So-called thermal films are particularly effective for increasing leaf temperature in passive, unheated greenhouses during clear nights. Polyethylene films are very transparent to long-wave IR radiation, therefore IR-absorbing additives are commonly used to improve the thermal properties of the films. Properties of greenhouse plastic covering materials relevant to GAP Clear films and diffusive films In areas with clear skies and high solar radiation, direct radiation can cause leaf burning in greenhouse crops on warm days. New plastic films have been developed to increase the percentage of diffuse radiation in the greenhouse. Radiation is considered “diffuse” when it deviates more than 2.5° from the TABLE 1 Density of different polymers used in horticulture Material Density (g/cm3) Low density polyethylene (LDPE) 0.915–0.930 Copolymer ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) 0.920–0.930 Copolymer ethylene butyl acrylate (EBA) 0.920–0.930 Polyvinyl chloride (flexible) (PVC) 1.250–1.500 Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) 1.180 Polyester/Fibreglass 1.500–1.600 Glass 2.400 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 42 direct incident radiation. The percentage of diffuse radiation to global radiation is known as turbidity.

Anti-dust films Most polymers are poor electricity conductors, particularly prone to the accumulation of static electricity when two surfaces are rubbed against each other or when there is friction caused by the wind. As a consequence, most plastics attract dust. To reduce static electricity, some additives that increase electrical conductivity can be incorporated into the interior or on the surface of the film. Montero et al. (2001) reported that dirt accumulation reduced light transmission of a new PE plastic film by approximately 6 percent after 1 year of exposure in coastal Spain. EVA films are reported to lose more light transmission due to dust accumulation. Anti-drip films Water vapour condenses on the cold inner cover surface forming small droplets of liquid water. This has negative consequences on light transmission; some condensation studies have reported PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) transmission losses close to 20 percent for incident radiation angles bigger than 15°. This loss in light transmission varies with drop size: large drops reduce transmission less than small drops due to the different Plate 4 Covering greenhouse films: clear film (left); diffusive film (right) Plate 5 Greenhouse covered with different plastic films Plate 6 Anti-dripping film (right side) 3. Greenhouse design and covering materials 43 contact angle of the drop with the plastic (Castilla, 2005). Moreover, condensation can fall onto the crop fostering development of fungal diseases. Anti-drip additives modify the surface tension of water, eliminate droplets and form instead a continuous thin layer of water (Figure 4). There are several methods for producing a continuous layer of condensed water, such as treatment of the film surface or oxidation of the polymer surface, but the most efficient method for agricultural films is the incorporation of additives during the manufacturing process. However, such additives migrate towards the plastic surface getting washed away by rain or condensation, and anti-drip properties are usually lost before the end of the plastic’s life span. One solution is to use multilayer plastics where one of the central layers is used as a reservoir of anti-drip additives which continuously replace the additives lost through washing. NIR-blocking plastic materials Only about half of the energy that enters a greenhouse as sun radiation is in the wavelength range useful for photosynthesis (PAR: photosynthetically active radiation). Nearly all the remaining energy fraction is in the near infrared range (NIR): it warms the greenhouse and crop and contributes to transpiration, none of which is necessarily always desirable (Figure 5). Some new plastic film prototypes contain NIR-reflecting pigments with several concentrations. A significant reduction of the sun radiation energy content in the NIR range is thus possible without much reduction in the PAR range. The effectiveness of NIR films on the reduction of greenhouse air and crop temperatures and their effects on crop yield and quality depends on a number of factors, such as the amount of NIR filtered by the film, the ventilation capacity of the greenhouse, the crop density and the canopy transpiration. The desk study of Hemming et al. (2006) showed that under Dutch conditions, mean air temperature in a Venlo-type greenhouse could be reduced by about 1 °C during the summer months, but the NIR film increased energy consumption for heating in the winter months. Field tests conducted in southern Spain produced FIGURE 4 Effect of condensation on light transmission: dropwise condensation (left); film condensation (right) FIGURE 5 Radiative properties of the cover A cover with high NIR reflectivity would reduce thermal load by 50% without reducing assimilation NIR (Near InfraRed) = 50% of energy UV 0 400 700 2 500 nm Wavelength Energy GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 44 more optimistic results – temperature reductions of up to 4 °C during summer months, and increased yield and quality of a pepper crop (García-Alonso et al., 2006).

Three application methods are possible for commercially available NIR- selective filters: as permanent additives or coatings of the cover; as seasonal “whitewash”; and as movable screens. The combination of external climate conditions and type of greenhouse determines the most appropriate form of application in a given location. Some of these factors have been taken into account in the study by Kempkes et al. (2008), which quantifies the expected benefits in terms of inside climate. They show that year-round filtering of the NIR component of sun radiation is unlikely to increase productivity, even in mild winter climates, unless the reflected energy can be used. Blocking UV radiation to limit harmful insect activity The term “UV blocking” is applied to plastic films and nets made by various manufacturers with different capacities to absorb sunlight below 380 nm. The two most harmful insects for crop production in Mediterranean greenhouses are Bemisia tabaci (whitefly) and Frankliniella occidentalis (thrips), mainly because both are effective vectors for the transmission of virus diseases. The ability of these insects to move is associated with UV radiation; hence, by using plastic materials that absorb UV radiation, virus-disease transmission can be mitigated (González et al., 2003). The subject is dealt with in more detail in the section on insect-proof screens. However, reducing UV radiation also limits the role of beneficial insects used for pollination, such as Apis mellifera (bees) and Bombus terrestris (bumblebees). Field tests in the Mediterranean area show that insect pollination is not affected, provided that enough time is given to the beehives to get accustomed to the low UV levels within the greenhouse. It must also be pointed out that blocking UV-radiation may have detrimental effects on secondary metabolism, i.e. plant defences and micronutritional quality of products (subjects not discussed in this chapter).

Greenhouse design and covering materials 45 INSECT-PROOF SCREENS FOR GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES In the Mediterranean and southeastern Europe most greenhouses are equipped with ventilation openings to provide good microclimate conditions for plant growth. Unfortunately, these vents serve also as a major port of entry for pests and, as a consequence, growers are forced to cover the vents completely and permanently with fine mesh screens to prevent pest invasion. Since the pests can be very small (e.g. whiteflies and thrips), very fine mesh screens are required to prevent their entry; these screens impede ventilation and, in some cases, reduce light transmission (Bethke et al., 1994; Klose and Tantau, 2004; Teitel, 2001). Moreover, the targeted insects are most abundant during the warm and hot seasons when effective ventilation is essential for avoiding stressful conditions for both crop plants and workers (Teitel, 2001). Screens are characterized by their porosity (ratio between open area and total area), mesh size, thread dimension (diameter or thickness), texture (woven, knitted, woven/knitted), colour, light transmission/reflection and resistance to airflow. Most insect-proof screens have square or rectangular openings and are made of monofilament threads. They are generally characterized by the term “mesh”, which is the number of open spaces per inch in each direction, delineated by the threads (e.g. a 50-mesh screen has 50 spaces per inch in either the warp or the weft direction). Usually, screens are a product of weaving: a set of threads (the warp) stretched in a frame, or loom, are bound together to form a Plastic covering materials – GAP recommendations • Multilayer rather than single-layer films are recommended since they allow addition of the positive properties of each of the components that form the film. • Diffusive films are preferred over clear films because they improve light uniformity and increase light interception by the crop. • EVA films on the outer surface of the cover are to be avoided in dusty areas due to higher losses in light transmission. • Anti-drip films improve transmission and reduce dripping from", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 46 coherent fabric by means of other threads (the weft) introduced at right angles to the warp threads and passing in a determinate order over and under them. In Europe, screens are generally characterized by the number of spaces per centimetre in each direction (e.g. a 10*20 screen has 10 spaces per centimetre in one direction and 20 in the other direction). Nevertheless, there could still be difficulties in characterizing a screen with a complex weave (i.e. where the threads do not form openings of a simple rectangular or square shape or when the threads are not a round monofilament fibre with an easily measured diameter). For such screens, there is still no reliable method of documentation; they can only be characterized with laboratory tests relating pressure drop on the fabric as a function of upstream velocity. Effect of insect-proof screens on ventilation An important consideration when designing a screen installation is the effect that screen materials have on airflow through the openings. It has been well documented that screens increase the pressure drop on the openings, which results in reduced ventilation. It is also well known that the pressure drop on screens is mainly a function of screen porosity. For a woven screen made of a monofilament thread and with a simple texture, it is possible to calculate the porosity (ε) from the geometric dimensions of the screen: Eq. 1 where: l and m are the distance between the centres of two adjacent weft and warp threads, respectively d is the diameter of the threads This porosity relates to an orthogonal projection of the screen. Teitel (2007), on the basis of data from literature, suggested the following correlation: Eq. 2 to estimate the effect screens on the vents have on temperature difference between greenhouse and ambient air with screens (∆TSW) and without screens (∆TW). Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that Equation 2 provides Plate 7 Samples of insect proof screens Top: simple geometries, round monofilament threads, rectangular holes Bottom right: complex geometry, round monofilament threads, irregular hole shapes (areas hard to measure) Bottom left: complex geometry, vertical threads round monofilament, horizontal threads some round monofilament, others with lashes ml d m d l ) )( ( − − = ε ) 4 5 ( w sw ε − ∆ = ∆ T T 3.

The change of ∆TSW / ∆TW with the porosity is shown in Figure 7: as the value of porosity increases, the ventilation rate increases and the inside/outside temperature difference decreases. From the study conducted by Pérez- Parra et al. (2004), it can be deduced that an anti-thrips screen can reduce ventilation by approximately 60–70 percent while an anti- aphid screen can reduce it by 40 percent. In recent years, methods have been developed to improve the unfavourable conditions in the greenhouse due to insect screens: • Incorporation of optical or electrical insect deterrents with insect screen, enabling growers to use low mesh screens while maintaining a high level of protection from pests. • Removal of insect screens from vents when the risk of pest invasion is low. • Maximization of screened area.

Photo-selective screens, colour effects and other modifications There are two possible explanations for the mechanism by which photo-selective screens provide protection against arthropod pests: • The light inside the greenhouse contains less UV light and therefore becomes “invisible” to the pest. There are reports of thrips and whiteflies preferring to move into UV-containing environments (Antignus et al., 2001; Costa et al., 2002; Doukas and Payne, 2007). • Higher levels of reflected sunlight deter pest landing. Reports indicate that thrips are repelled by high UV reflectance (Matteson et al., 1992; Vernon and Gillespie, 1990). Furthermore, total light reflection by aluminium mulches and aluminium-coloured screens also reduces pest infestations in both open fields and protected crops (Greer and Dole, 2003). In recent years crops have been grown under coloured nets to promote beneficial physiological responses (Shahak et al., 2008). Nets used are yellow or blue, colours known to attract whiteflies and thrips, respectively. The risk for pest infestation under these nets is equal to or lower than the risk under black nets. FIGURE 7 Change of normalized ventilation rate (Nsw/ Nw) and temperature difference (DTsw/DTw) 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 NSW / NW ; TSW / TW ε Screen porosity GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 48 While pests prefer landing on the coloured nets, they remain there for a long time; this form of arrestment response (Bukovinszky et al., 2005) makes the pests less likely to infest the plants underneath these nets. Adding “arrestment colours” to insect screens is likely to reduce the risk of pest invasion in the greenhouse. A promising new electrostatic insect-proof screen (electric dipolar screen) was developed by Tanaka et al. (2008). This screen prevented all adult whiteflies from passing through sparse screens with spaces of up to 30 mm between the wires. Tomato plants grown under the electrostatic screen had no whitefly infestation, while there were heavy infestations of plants under a similar uncharged screen. Removing insect screen from vents when the risk of pest invasion is low Optimal climatic conditions in the greenhouse are often maintained by closing and opening windows and vents. However, insect screens covering windows and vents are not regulated in response to changes in the risk of invasion by pests. Greenhouse ventilation is likely to be improved if ventilation openings are uncovered when there is no risk of pest invasion (Ben-Yakir et al., 2008). In the fall, when the whitefly population peaks, over 97 percent of whiteflies entered the greenhouse between 7.00 and 13.00 hours (Teitel et al., 2005). Thus, the risk of whitefly entering greenhouses in the afternoon and at night is negligible. The flight of onion thrips and western flower thrips was studied using sticky pole traps and similar traps mounted on wind vanes. For most of the year, about 85 percent of the thrips were caught in the morning and 10 percent at dusk (Ben-Yakir and Chen, 2008). Mateus et al. (1996) also reported that F. occidentalis in a pepper greenhouse had two daily flight peaks: one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Flight time was correlated with periods of low wind speed and thrips were seldom caught with wind > 10 km/h. It has been reported that thrips in the genus Frankliniella are deterred from taking off when wind speed exceeds 9 km/h (Lewis, 1997). Both whiteflies and thrips are not likely to enter protected crops during the hot and windy afternoon hours or at night. Therefore, insect screens may be removed from vents during those times. Nevertheless there is no general agreement between experts on the convenience of removing insect screens, so at present it cannot be considered a general GAP.

Maximizing the screened area One method for increasing ventilation in multi-span greenhouses with roof openings on which screens are mounted is to increase the maximum angle at which the flap can be opened. Another option is to fit the frames of the openings with pre-formed concertina-shaped screens that unfold as the ventilators open and then fold up again when they close (Plate 8). Teitel et al. (2008) have shown that a concertina-shaped screen allows higher airflow (an increase of about 25%) when compared with a flat screen under similar pressure drops across the screen. Recent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, carried out by Teitel (unpublished data) suggest that concertina-shaped screens may allow much higher 3. Greenhouse design and covering materials 49 ventilation rates (depending on the ratio between the concertina and flat screen area). In addition to the effects on insect penetration and the ventilation rate, the screens reduce light transmission into the greenhouse by creating strips of shadow on the crop when they are installed on roof openings. In dusty regions the shadow effect may worsen with time due to the accumulation of dust on the screens. Klose and Tantau (2004) found that although screens with the largest distance between adjacent threads had the highest light transmission, screens with the smallest distance did not necessarily have the lowest. Hence, they concluded that light transmission was influenced by additional parameters, such as the structure of the threads and, of course, accumulation of dirt. Plate 8 Concertina-shaped screens installed in the roof openings of a Venlo greenhouse Insect-proof screens – GAP recommendations • Insect-proof screens produce a major reduction in ventilation; it is estimated that an anti-thrip screen can reduce ventilation by 60–70 percent while an anti-aphid screen can reduce it by 40 percent. • Ventilation reduction can be mitigated by increasing the ventilation surface and by increasing the screen area as in concertina-shaped screens. • Screens with a smaller thread diameter are preferred as they are more porous and ventilate better. • Photo-selective screens provide extra protection against pests. Moreover, adding “arrestment colours” (e.g. blue and yellow) is likely to reduce the risk of pest invasion in the greenhouse. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 50 TRENDS IN NATURAL VENTILATION Proper ventilation performance is crucial for greenhouses in both humid winter climates and hot summer conditions. The ventilation process contributes to optimal control of air temperature, humidity and concentration of gases within the greenhouse. Thus, photosynthetic and transpiration activities of plants are regulated properly and crop quality is improved. Given the advantages – low maintenance, low operational costs and reduced noise – natural ventilation is used by the great majority of growers in the Mediterranean area since it is the most inexpensive way to regulate greenhouse internal microclimate area. However, control of airflow with natural ventilation is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse natural ventilation properly and increase ventilation efficiency. The driving force for natural ventilation is the pressure difference across the ventilation openings caused by wind and/or thermal effects. Wind-driven ventilation When the wind blows around a greenhouse, the wind field generates pressure distribution through the greenhouse. Moreover, wind has a fluctuating character that creates a fluctuating pressure difference over the openings; the mean difference in pressure and the fluctuating pressure difference are responsible for the airflow through the greenhouse ventilators (Bot, 1983; de Jong, 1990). There are claims that air exchange is proportional to outside wind velocity. Thermally driven ventilation Under calm conditions, buoyancy forces (differences between inside and outside air densities) are the driving mechanism for ventilation, but the effect of thermal buoyancy on ventilation is of fundamental interest when there is almost no wind (Baeza et al., 2009). It has been reported that winds over 2 m/s dominate the ventilation process, making the effect of air temperature difference negligible (Bot, 1983; Papadakis et al., 1996; Mistriotis et al., 1997a). Buoyancy-driven ventilation is more important when wind speeds are below 0.5 m/s (Baeza et al., 2009). Generally speaking, for intermediate and higher wind speeds, where 0.5 m/s < u < 2.5 m/s, ventilation is driven mostly by wind effect", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Generally speaking, for intermediate and higher wind speeds, where 0.5 m/s < u < 2.5 m/s, ventilation is driven mostly by wind effect and with some influence of buoyancy (Mistriotis et al., 1997a) (Figure 8). Natural ventilation can be achieved by opening windows at the top of the FIGURE 8 Buoyancy versus wind-driven ventilation 3. Greenhouse design and covering materials 51 greenhouse and/or at the sidewalls. The number and size of the windows and the mechanisms for window opening vary, with many different arrangements used in glasshouses and plastic-covered houses. Ridge openings can be classified as “continuous” or “non-continuous” and they are usually on both sides of the ridge, although hoses with openings on one side only are also constructed. Roof vents are either fixed or fully automatic (movable roof vents). A fixed overlapping vent on a gable ridge provides ventilation while preventing penetration of rain and hail. Movable roof vents may be formed by: film roll-up from gutter to ridge; ridge- hinged arched vents; vertical openings at the centre of the arch running the entire length of the roof; vertical roof openings starting at the gutters and extending to a height of about 1 m; or vertical openings at the centre of the arched roof running the entire length of the roof. The position and hinging of the vent at the ridge are the basis of a better evacuation of the hot and humid air which builds up at the top of the greenhouse. In Venlo greenhouses, the ventilators in most of the houses are hinged from the ridge and extend halfway to the gutter or as far as the gutter. The idea is to provide a large opening area especially in warm and humid areas. Recent greenhouse designs provide retractable roofs. Side ventilation is usually achieved by rolling up curtains with a central mechanism operated manually or by an electric motor. Mechanisms that open the side vents from bottom to top (or vice versa, although less common) are available. Side openings with flaps hinged from the top are also used; however, they are more common in glasshouses than in plastic-covered houses. Flap ventilators are more efficient than rolling ventilators, particularly under moderate wind conditions. Airflow characteristics under wind-driven ventilation The latest advances in ventilation are based on numerical models, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to solve the governing equations. By using CFD models it is possible to obtain detailed vector fields of air velocity in and around the greenhouse, or precise fields of temperature, humidity or other variables relevant to greenhouse climate studies. Plate 9 Flap ventilators on the roof and rolling ventilators on the side wall (left) Rolling ventilators on the roof (right) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 52 In order to better understand greenhouse ventilation, leeward and windward ventilation are examined in detail below. Windward ventilation is preferred to leeward ventilation for greenhouses located in warm areas, since windward ventilation clearly increases the ventilation rate (Pérez-Parra, 2002). Nevertheless, the internal climate is generally less uniform with windward ventilation. Windward ventilation The external air is “captured” by the vent opening of the first span. This results in an internal flow with the same direction as the external air. The first windward roof ventilator has the most significant effect on the intensity of air exchange and internal airflow (Baeza, 2007). Leeward ventilation The external wind follows the windward roof of the first span and accelerates along the roof. The external flow separates from the greenhouse structure at the ridge of the first windward span and creates an area of low speed above subsequent spans. Greenhouse air exits the greenhouse through the first roof ventilator, creating an internal flow which is opposite the external flow. As for windward ventilation, the first ventilator plays the leading role in the air exchange process (Flores, 2010). This is the general outline of the air pattern for windward and leeward ventilation, but in very wide greenhouses the internal airflow may be different. Mistriotis et al. (1997b) and Reichrath and Davies (2001)", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Greenhouse air exits the greenhouse through the first roof ventilator, creating an internal flow which is opposite the external flow. As for windward ventilation, the first ventilator plays the leading role in the air exchange process (Flores, 2010). This is the general outline of the air pattern for windward and leeward ventilation, but in very wide greenhouses the internal airflow may be different. Mistriotis et al. (1997b) and Reichrath and Davies (2001) have detected the occurrence of a dead zone with low velocity at approximately 60 percent of the total glasshouse length for a very large Venlo-type greenhouse (60 spans) under similar pure leeward ventilation conditions. Similarly, windward ventilation in wide greenhouses produces two clearly differentiated circulation areas. The zone where both circulation cells meet is a dead zone with low air movement and high temperature. The general recommendation is, whenever possible, to limit greenhouse width to approximately 50 m (Baeza, 2007) and to leave a separation between adjacent greenhouses to allow hot air to escape. Sidewall ventilation Sidewall ventilation is similar to windward roof ventilation with respect to the airflow pattern, since for sidewall ventilation the external air also enters the greenhouse through the windward side and passes along the greenhouse width. Kacira et al. (2004a) conducted CFD simulations to investigate the effect of side vents in relation to the span number of a gothic greenhouse with a continuous roof vent on the leeward side of each ridge. Compared with roof ventilation only, it was found that when both sides were fully open the ventilation rate increased strongly. The study showed that the maximum greenhouse ventilation rate was achieved when both side and roof vents were used for ventilation. Without buoyancy effect in the computations, the ventilation rate increased linearly with the external wind speed. The ratio of the opening of the ventilator area to the greenhouse 3. Greenhouse design and covering materials 53 floor area (9.6%) was found to be small compared with the recommended ratios of 15–25 percent. The results showed that a significant reduction in ventilation rate was determined as the number of spans was increased (from 6 to 24) and an exponential decay described the relationship between the ventilation rate and the number of spans. Sidewall ventilation may help reduce the area of the dead zone with high temperatures typical of wide greenhouses. However, side ventilation is not accepted by many growers who are reluctant to open the sidewall and roof ventilators in the windward direction, as they want to protect their crops and greenhouse frames from potential wind damage. For this reason, side deflectors are currently being put into practice (Baeza, 2007) and simple mechanisms to protect ventilators against wind gusts are becoming popular in Mediterranean countries. Suggestions to improve natural ventilation Use of deflectors As pointed out by Sase (2006), in many types of ventilator the incoming air mainly follows the inner surface of the roof and creates a crossflow above the crop without mixing with the air in the crop area. To avoid this problem, the use of screens or deflectors to redirect the air stream is recommended. Nielsen (2002) offered a method to direct the passing airflow at the hinged ridge vents into the crop space (Figure 9): using a 1-m high vertical screen mounted to the ridge, improvements were achieved in the air exchange in the plant zone of about 50 percent on average. Kacira et al. (2004b) evaluated the optimization of the traditional vent configuration for a two-span glasshouse for better air renewal especially in the plant canopy zone. The study was based on three-dimensional numerical FIGURE 9 Effect of a deflector at the roof ventilator on internal air circulation Nielsen, 2002 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 54 simulations using the CFD approach. The study evaluated both roll-up and butterfly-type side vent openings and various roof vent opening configurations (Figure 10). The maximum greenhouse ventilation rates were achieved when roll- up side vents were used in the sidewalls, and both side and roof vents were fully open. Use of the roll-up side vent considerably improved the ventilation rate in the plant canopy zone. This showed that ventilation in the plant canopy zone was significantly affected by the internal airflow patterns caused by different vent configurations (Figure 11). Kacira et al.

This showed that ventilation in the plant canopy zone was significantly affected by the internal airflow patterns caused by different vent configurations (Figure 11). Kacira et al. (2004b) demonstrated the importance of analysing the ventilation rates in the plant canopy zone as well as above the canopy. For example, under the same external wind speed and plant existence conditions, the ventilation rates in FIGURE 10 The effect of side vent configuration on the canopy zone ventilation and air exchange process Roll up side vents (left); butterfly type side vents (right) FIGURE 11 Effects of external wind speed and vent configuration on ventilation rates of greenhouse and plant canopy Kacira et al., 2004b 3. Greenhouse design and covering materials 55 the greenhouse were found to be similar between the butterfly and roll-up curtain side vent configurations (Cases 1 and 3, Figure 11). However, the majority of the incoming air in the butterfly side vent cases did not reach the plant canopy zone. Conversely, the contribution of air entering the greenhouse from the windward roll-up curtain side vent for airflow uniformity and the achievement of higher ventilation rates in the plant canopy zone were found to be significant. The overall data showed that the ventilation in the plant canopy zone was considerably affected by the internal airflow patterns caused by different vent configurations. Changes in the greenhouse slope Increasing the greenhouse roof slope has a positive effect on the ventilation rate. Baeza (2007) compared the air exchange rate and internal airflow of greenhouses with slopes ranging from 12° to 32°. According to this study, ventilation sharply increased with roof slopes of up to 25°, after which the increase in ventilation was rather small. The low slope does not only affect the ventilation rate but also the air movement inside the greenhouse. Most of the airflow entering through the windward vent on a gentle slope attaches to the greenhouse cover, while with steeper slopes part of the airflow contributes to the ventilation of the first span and part of it moves on to the following span decreasing the attachment effect observed for lower slopes. Size and type of ventilators Baeza (2007) analysed the effect of ventilator size on greenhouse climate. He increased the flap ventilator size from 0.8 to 1.6 m in the first two and last two spans while maintaining the regular size of 0.8 m in the central spans. For a ten-span greenhouse, the increase in ventilator size had a significant effect on the ventilation rate. Besides, air movement in the crop area was enhanced. As a consequence, the temperature field was more uniform, the temperature difference in relation to the exterior was reduced and the stagnant air areas (warm spots) were significantly fewer in number and smaller in size. This study suggested that the greenhouse climate can be improved by making modest investments only in ventilators located in the first and last spans, which are critical to the air exchange process. With regard to the ventilator type, Pérez-Parra (2004) compared flap ventilators and roll-up ventilators on the greenhouse roof under leeward and windward conditions. Flap ventilators were in all cases more effective at increasing ventilation rate than roll-up ventilators. Interestingly, the roll-up ventilator’s performance was not affected by wind direction, while flap ventilators oriented windward side nearly doubled the air exchange of leeward flap ventilators. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 56 Crop row orientation Sase (1989) conducted a ventilation study to compare the effect of the crop rows perpendicular and parallel to the sidewalls. As seen in Figure 12, the inside air velocity in the greenhouse with perpendicular rows was nearly twice that of the greenhouse with parallel rows; the crop canopy is a porous medium that offers resistance to the airflow, so it is recommended that the aisle between rows be oriented in the direction of the internal airflow. Sase’s study was conducted in a small greenhouse where side ventilation prevailed over roof ventilation. For roof ventilation only, the effect of the crop orientation may be less important, since in roof ventilated greenhouses there is strong air", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

New greenhouse designs with improved ventilation All the recently developed knowledge can be put together to produce better ventilation designs. Upcoming greenhouse models relying on natural ventilation should be narrow enough (maximum width 50 m) to avoid excessive temperature gradients; furthermore, they should have larger ventilators, especially in the first span facing prevailing winds. They will incorporate screens or deflectors to redirect the airflow towards the crop area producing a homogeneous mixture FIGURE 12 Inside air velocity as a function of outside air velocity for a greenhouse with crop rows parallel and perpendicular to the side wall 3. Greenhouse design and covering materials 57 of the incoming and internal air, to have uniform growing conditions (Figure 13). Effective windward ventilation requires keeping an area between greenhouses free from obstacles. For proper ventilation, future greenhouse designs will not consider a single greenhouse, but a group or a greenhouse cluster, since the airflow in a greenhouse is affected by its surroundings. Natural ventilation is the main method for greenhouse cooling, mainly because of the low energy consumption and reduced maintenance costs. However, natural ventilation relies on external conditions such as wind speed and direction and outside air temperature and humidity. Natural ventilation itself may not be sufficient to provide the desired environment under certain conditions. Thus, some other cooling techniques such as shading, mechanical ventilation or evaporative cooling, are used combined with natural ventilation. For a full discussion, it is necessary to consult the specific literature (Arbel et al., 2006; Li et al., 2006; Lorenzo et al., 2004; Abdel- Ghany and Kozai, 2006; Abdel-Ghany et al., 2006).

The majority of plants grown in greenhouses are warm-season species, adapted to average temperatures in the range 17–27 °C, with approximate lower and upper limits of 10 and 35 °C. If the average minimum outside temperature is < 10 °C, the greenhouse is likely to require heating, particularly at night. When the average maximum outside temperature is < 27 °C, ventilation will prevent excessive internal temperatures during the day; however, if the average maximum temperature is > 27–28 °C, artificial cooling may be necessary. The maximum greenhouse temperature should not exceed 30–35 °C for prolonged periods. The climograph of some Mediterranean and north European regions is shown in Figure 1. In temperate climates, as in the Netherlands, heating and ventilation enable the temperature to be controlled throughout the year, while at lower latitudes, such as in Almería (Spain) and Volos (Greece), the daytime temperatures are too high for ventilation to provide sufficient cooling during the summer. Positive cooling is then required to achieve suitable temperatures. The second important variable is humidity, traditionally expressed in terms of relative humidity. Relative humidity within the range of 60–90 percent has little GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 64 effect on plants. Values below 60 percent may occur during ventilation in arid climates, or when plants are young with small leaves, and this can cause water stress. Serious problems can occur if relative humidity exceeds 95 percent for long periods, particularly at night as this favours the rapid development of fungus diseases such as Botrytis cinerea. The increased interest in maintaining adequate transpiration to avoid problems associated with calcium deficiency (Plate 1) has resulted in humidity being expressed in terms of the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) or the moisture deficit, both of which are directly related to transpiration. Maintaining the VPD above a minimum value helps to ensure adequate transpiration and also reduces disease problems. During the day, humidity can usually be reduced using ventilation. However, at night, unless the greenhouse is heated, the internal and external temperatures may be similar; if the external humidity is high, reducing the greenhouse humidity is not easy.

Greenhouse climate control and energy use 65 Following the energy crisis of the early 1980s, when limited energy supplies led to the first significant rise in energy prices, greenhouse energy use became a major research issue. With the recent increased interest in global warming and climate change, the use of fossil fuels is again on the political agenda and many governments have set maximum CO2 emission levels for various industries, including the greenhouse sector. There are two main ways to increase greenhouse energy efficiency: • reduce the energy input into the greenhouse system; and • increase production per unit of energy. The challenge is to meet both needs: improved energy efficiency combined with an absolute reduction in the overall energy consumption and related CO2 emissions of the greenhouse industry. Technological innovations must focus on energy consumption for the return to productivity, quality and societal satisfaction. There are a range of greenhouse system technologies which can be adopted by growers to improve climate control and energy use. However, there are numerous obstacles and constraints to overcome. The existing technology and know-how developed in north European countries are generally not directly transferable to the Mediterranean: high-level technology is beyond the means of most Mediterranean growers due to the high cost compared with the modest investment capacity; and know-how from north European growers is often inappropriate for the problems encountered in the Mediterranean shelters (Plate 2).

Where these tecnologies may be adopted, it is necessary to train and educate Mediterranean growers. To this end, specific research and development tasks have been initiated by the research institutes and extension services of Mediterranean countries. The issues addressed in this paper concern the means and best practices by which Mediterranean growers can alleviate the climate-generated stress conditions that inhibit the growth and the development of crops during the long warm season in a sustainable and energy-friendly way. Plate 2 Internal view of parral (left, mainly found in Spain) and Venlo (right, mainly found in the Netherlands) type greenhouse GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 66 CLIMATE CONTROL Ventilation cooling and shading Removal of heat load is the major concern for greenhouse climate management in arid and semi-arid climate conditions. This can be achieved by: • reducing incoming solar radiation; • removing extra heat through air exchange; and • increasing the fraction of energy partitioned into latent heat. Shade screens and whitewash are the principle measures taken to reduce incoming solar radiation; greenhouse ventilation is an effective way to remove extra heat through air exchange between the inside and outside (when the outside air temperature is lower); and evaporative cooling is the common technique for reducing sensible heat load by increasing the latent heat fraction of dissipated energy. Other technological cooling solutions are available (heat pump, heat exchangers), but are not widely used, especially in the Mediterranean area because they require a high level of investment. Ventilation High summer temperatures mean that heat must constantly be removed from the greenhouse. A simple and effective way of reducing the difference between inside and outside air temperatures is to improve ventilation. Natural or passive ventilation requires very little external energy. It is based on the pressure difference between the greenhouse and the outside environment, resulting from the outside wind or the greenhouse temperature. If the greenhouse is equipped with ventilation openings (Plate 3), both near the ground and at the roof, hot internal air is replaced by cooler external air during hot sunny days when there is a slight wind. The external cool air enters the greenhouse through the lower side openings while the hot internal air exits through the roof openings due to the density difference between air masses of different temperature; the result is a lowering of the greenhouse temperature. Sufficient ventilation is very important for optimal plant growth, especially in the case of high outside temperatures and solar radiation – common conditions during the summer in Mediterranean countries. In order to study the variables determining greenhouse air temperature and calculate the necessary measurements for temperature control, a simplified version of the greenhouse energy balance is formulated. Kittas et al. (2005) simplify the greenhouse energy balance to: FIGURE 2 Greenhouse energy balance 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 67 Eq. 1 where: Va is the ratio Q/Ag, Q is the ventilation flow rate (m3 [air] s-1) Ag is the greenhouse ground surface area (m2) τ is the greenhouse transmission coefficient to solar radiation Rs,o-max is the maximum outside solar radiation (W m-2) ΔΤ is the temperature difference between greenhouse and outside air (°C) Using Equation 1, it is easy to calculate the ventilation requirements for several values of Rs,o-max and ΔT. For the area of Magnesia, Greece, where values of outside solar radiation exceed 900 W m-2 during the critical summer period (Kittas et al., 2005), a ventilation rate of about 0.06 m3 s-1 m-2 (which corresponds, for a greenhouse with a mean height of 3 m, to an air exchange of 60 h-1) is needed in order to maintain a ΔT of about 4 °C. The necessary ventilation rate can be obtained by natural or forced ventilation; ventilators should, if possible, be located at the ridge, on the sidewalls and the gable.

Some systems, including exhaust fan and blower, can supply high air exchange rates when needed. These simple and robust systems significantly increase the rate of air transfer from the greenhouse; consequently, the inside temperature can be kept at a level slightly above the outside temperature (Plate 4).

Fans suck air out on one side, and openings on the other side let air in. Forced ventilation by fans is the most effective way to ventilate a greenhouse, but it consumes electricity. It is estimated that the electrical energy requirements for ventilation of a greenhouse located in the Mediterranean are about 70 000 kWh per greenhouse ha. Kittas et al. (2001) studied the influence of the greenhouse ventilation regime (natural or forced ventilation) on the energy partitioning of a well-watered rose canopy during several summer days in warm Mediterranean conditions (eastern Greece). When not limited by too low external wind speed, natural ventilation could be more appropriate than forced ventilation, creating a more humid and cooler environment (albeit less homogeneous) around the canopy. Many researchers also studied the effects on greenhouse microclimate of insect-proof screens in roof openings (Plate 5). Fine mesh screens obstruct the airflow, resulting in reduced air velocity and higher temperature and humidity, as well as an increase in the thermal gradients within the greenhouse (Katsoulas et al., 2006). Shading Natural or forced ventilation is generally not sufficient for extracting the excess energy during sunny summer days (Baille, 1999), and other cooling methods must be used in combination with ventilation. The entry of direct solar radiation through the covers into the greenhouse enclosure is the primary source of heat gain. The entry of unwanted radiation (or light) can be controlled by shading or reflection. Shading can be achieved in several ways: paints, external shade cloths, nets (of various colours), partially reflective shade screens (Plate 6), water film over the roof and liquid foams between the greenhouse walls. Shading is the last resort for cooling greenhouses, because it affects productivity; however, shading can in some cases result in improved quality. A method widely Plate 5 Insect-proof screen in roof opening Plate 6 Thermal screen used for energy saving and greenhouse shading Plate 4 Fans for greenhouse forced ventilation 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 69 adopted by growers because of its low cost is white painting, or whitening, of the cover material. The use of screens has been progressively accepted by growers and the last decade has seen an increase in the area of field crops cultivated under screenhouses (Cohen et al., 2005). Roof whitening, given its low cost, is common practice in the Mediterranean Basin. Baille et al. (2001) reported that whitening on glass material enhanced slightly the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) proportion of the incoming solar irradiance, thus reducing the solar infrared fraction entering the greenhouse – a potential advantage compared with other shading devices, especially in warm Ventilation – GAP recommendations • For a coastal area like Magnesia, Greece, where during the critical summer period, outside solar radiation exceeds 900 W m-2, a ventilation rate of about 0.06 m3 s-1 m-2 (corresponding, for a greenhouse with a mean height of 3 m, to an air exchange of 60 h-1) is needed to maintain a ΔT of about 4 °C.

These simple and robust systems significantly increase the air transfer rate from the greenhouse, maintaining the inside temperature at a level slightly higher than the outside temperature by increasing the number of air changes. • Forced ventilation by fans is the most effective way to ventilate a greenhouse, but electricity consumption is high. The estimated electrical energy requirements for ventilation of a greenhouse located in the Mediterranean are about 70 000 kWh per greenhouse ha. • Ventilation fans should develop a capacity of about 30 Pa static pressure (3 mm on a water gauge), they should be located on the lee side or the lee end of the greenhouse, and the distance between two fans should not exceed 8–10 m. Furthermore, an inlet opening on the opposite side of a fan should be at least 1.25 times the fan area. The velocity of the incoming air must not be too high in the plant area; air speed should not exceed 0.5 m s-1. The openings must close automatically when the fans are not in operation. • With fan cooling alone (no evaporative cooling), little advantage can be derived from increasing airflow rates beyond 0.05 m s-1. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 70 countries with high radiation load during summer. Another advantage of whitening is that it does not affect ventilation, while internal shading nets negatively affect the performance of roof ventilation. Whitening also significantly increases the fraction of diffuse irradiance, which is known to enhance radiation-use efficiency. Screens mounted inside the greenhouse also contribute to decreasing the inside wind speed, thus lessening the leaf boundary layer and restraining the availability of CO2 near the leaf surface. It is not clear whether shading nets are best used throughout the growth cycle or only during the most sensitive stages when the crops have a low leaf area and the canopy transpiration rate cannot significantly contribute to the greenhouse cooling (Seginer, 1994). Evaporative cooling One of the most efficient solutions for alleviating climatic conditions is to use evaporative cooling systems, based on the conversion of sensible heat into latent heat through evaporation of water supplied directly into the greenhouse atmosphere (mist or fog system, sprinklers) or via evaporative pads (wet pads). Evaporative cooling allows simultaneous lowering of temperature and vapour pressure deficit, and its efficiency is higher in dry environments. The advantage of mist and fog systems over wet pad systems is the uniformity of conditions throughout the greenhouse, eliminating the need for forced ventilation and airtight enclosure. Before installing a system, the air- and waterflow rates required must be calculated. Fog system Water is sprayed as small droplets (in the fog range, 2–60 nm in diameter) with high pressure into the air above the plants in order to increase the water surface in contact with the air (Plate 7). Freefall velocity of these droplets is slow and the air streams inside the greenhouse easily carry the drops. This can result in high efficiency of water evaporation combined with keeping the foliage dry. Fogging is also used to create high relative humidity, along with cooling inside the greenhouse. A wide range for fog system cooling efficiency (nf,cool) is reported in the literature. According to Arbel et al. (2003), increased efficiency in the cooling process in relation to water consumption can be expected if fogging is combined with a reduced ventilation rate.

(2006), who concluded that fog cooling efficiency increases with spray rate and decreases with ventilation rate. Plate 7 Fog system used for greenhouse cooling 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 71 Fan and pad cooling The fan-and-pad cooling system (Plate 8) is most commonly used in horticulture. Air from outside is blown through pads with as large a surface as possible and which are kept permanently wet by sprinkling. The water from the pads evaporates and cools the air; outside air humidity must therefore be low. There are basically two systems of fan-and-pad cooling: the negative-pressure system and the positive-pressure system. • The negative-pressure system consists of a pad on one side of the greenhouse and a fan on the other. The fans suck the air through the pad and through the greenhouse. The pressure inside the greenhouse is lower than the pressure outside; hot air and dust can therefore get into the greenhouse. There is a temperature gradient from pad to fan. Evaporative cooling – GAP recommendations 1: fog system • Evaporative cooling allows simultaneous lowering of temperature and vapour pressure deficit and can lead to greenhouse air temperatures lower than the outside air temperature. Efficiency increases in dry environments. • The advantage of mist and fog systems over wet pad systems is the uniformity of conditions throughout the greenhouse, eliminating the need for forced ventilation and airtight enclosure. Before installing a system, the air- and waterflow rates required must be calculated. • Fog systems can be high (40 bars) or low (5 bars) pressure systems; high pressure systems are more effective than low pressure. • The nozzles of the fog system should be located at the highest possible position inside the greenhouse to allow water evaporation before the water drops to the crop or the ground. • During operation of the fog system, a vent opening of 20 percent of the maximum aperture should be maintained. • Nozzles with fans provided 1.5 times better evaporation ratio and three times wider cooling area than nozzles without fans. Nozzles with fans produce a lower and more uniform air temperature. Plate 8 Pad (left) and fan (right) greenhouse cooling system GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 72 • The positive-pressure system consists of fans and pads on one side of the greenhouse and vents on the other. The fans blow the air through the pads into the greenhouse. The pressure inside the greenhouse is higher than outside; dust cannot get into the greenhouse. In order to achieve optimal cooling, the greenhouse should be shaded. The waterflow rate, water distribution system, pump capacity, recirculation rate and output rate of the fan-and-pad cooling system must be carefully calculated and designed to provide a sufficient wetting of the pad and to avoid deposition of material. The manufacturers’ guidelines for pad selection and installation must be observed; furthermore, there are numerous considerations when designing a fan-and-pad cooling system. First, cooling efficiency should provide inside air humidity of about 85 percent at the outlet; higher air humidity slows down the transpiration rate of the plants. Plant temperature can then increase above air temperature. It is important that the pad material have a high surface, good wetting properties and high cooling efficiency. It should cause little pressure loss, and should be durable. The average thickness of the pad is 100–200 mm. It is essential that the pad be free of leaks through which air could pass without making contact with the pad. Different pad materials are available, such as wood, wool, swelling clay minerals, and specially impregnated cellulose paper. The pad area depends on the airflow rate necessary for the cooling system and the permissible surface velocity over the pad. Average face velocities are 0.75–1.5 m s-1.

Excessive velocities may cause problems with drops entering the greenhouse. The pad area should be about 1 m2 per 20–30 m2 greenhouse area. The maximum fan-to-pad distance should be 30–40 m. Pads may be positioned horizontally or vertically (more often the latter). Vertical pads are supplied with water from a perforated pipe along the top edge. In the case of horizontal pads, the water is sprayed over the upper surface. The water distribution must ensure even wetting of the pad. Pads have to be protected from direct sunlight to prevent localized drying out: salt and sand might clog them if they become dry. In areas with frequent sandstorms it is recommended to protect the wet pad with a thin dry pad serving as a sand filter. The pads have to be located and mounted in a way which permits easy maintenance and cleaning. They should be located on the side facing the prevailing wind. Belt-driven or direct-driven propeller fans are used. Direct-driven fans are easier to maintain. Fans should be placed on the lee side of the greenhouse. If they are on the windward side, an increase of 10 percent in the ventilation rate will be needed. The distance between fans should not exceed 7.5–10 m, and fans should not discharge towards the pads of an adjacent greenhouse less than 15 m away. All 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 73 exhaust fans should be equipped with automatic shutters to prevent air exchange when fans are not operating, and also to prevent back-draught when some are not being used. When starting the cooling system, the waterflow through the pad should be turned on first to prevent the pads from clogging. Fans should not be started before the whole pad has been completely wetted. When stopping the cooling system in the evening, the fan should be turned off before the waterflow through the pad. It is recommended to operate the cooling system by a simple control system depending on the inside temperature. The airflow rate depends on the solar radiation inside the greenhouse – that is, on the cladding material and shading – and on the evapotranspiration rate from the plants and soil. The airflow rate can be calculated by an energy balance. Generally, a basic airflow rate of 120–150 m3 per m2 greenhouse area per hour will permit satisfactory operation of an evaporative cooling system. Evaporative cooling – GAP recommendations 2: fan and pad • The pad material should have a high surface, good wetting properties and high cooling efficiency. Suggested pad thickness is 200 mm. It is very important that there are no leaks where air can pass through without making contact with the pad. • The pad area depends on the airflow rate necessary for the cooling system and the permissible surface velocity over the pad. Average face velocities are 0.75–1.5 m s-1. The pad area should be about 1 m2 per 20–30 m2 greenhouse area. The maximum fan-to-pad distance should be 40 m. • Fans should be placed on the lee side of the greenhouse. If they are on the windward side, an increase of 10 percent in the ventilation rate is necessary.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 74 Heating Greenhouse heating is essential even in countries with a temperate climate, like the Mediterranean region, in order to maximize crop production in terms of quantity and quality and thus to increase overall efficiency. Heating costs are not only directly connected to profitability, but in the long term they may determine the survival of the greenhouse industry. In addition to the costs of high energy consumption, heating is associated with environmental problems through the emission of noxious gases. Heating needs There are various ways to calculate greenhouse heating needs (Hg) (W). The simplest is proposed by ASAE (2000): Eq. 2 where: U = heat loss coefficient (W m-2 K-1) (see Table 1) A = exposed greenhouse surface area (m2) Ti = inside air temperature (K) To = outside air temperature (K) Note that the estimation of greenhouse needs using Equation 2 did not take into account heat loss due to leakage. However it is a simple formula which can be used in order to estimate heating needs according to the greenhouse covering area and the desired temperature difference between inside and outside air.

Greenhouse climate control and energy use 75 Heating systems The heating system must provide heat to the greenhouse at the same rate at which it is lost. There are several popular types of heating systems for greenhouses. The most common and least expensive is the unit heater system. Unit heaters Warm air is blown from unit heaters with self-contained fireboxes. Heaters are located throughout the greenhouse, each heating a floor area of 180–500 m2. The typical cost, including installation is €4–8/m2 of greenhouse floor. Central heating Steam or hot water is produced, plus a radiating mechanism in the greenhouse to dissipate the heat (Plate 9). The typical cost of a central boiler system for 1 ha, including heat distribution and installation, is €30–80/m2 of greenhouse floor space, depending on the number of heat zones and the exact heat requirement. Calculation of greenhouse heating needs 1. Measure the first three dimensions of the greenhouse: - Measure the length, width and height of the structure (to where the roof begins). 2. Measure the ridge of the greenhouse: - Measure the distance between the ground and the tip of the greenhouse’s roof. 3. Measure the slope of the greenhouse roof: - The slope is the distance from the tip of the roof to the bottom of the roof. 4. Determine the surface area of the greenhouse’s roof slope and two walls: - Use the formula: 2 × (H + S) × L where H = height, S = roof slope and L = length. 5. Determine the surface area of the remaining two walls: - Use the formula: (R + H) × W where R = ridge, H = height and W = width. 6. Determine the total surface area of the greenhouse: - Add together the results from step 4 and step 5. 7. Calculate the desired temperature difference: - Determine the best temperature for the interior of the greenhouse. - Determine the average coldest temperature for the area surrounding the greenhouse. - Determine the difference between the two temperatures. 8. Estimate the overall heat loss coefficient: - According to the covering material, refer to Table 1. 9. Estimate the heating needs of the greenhouse: - Multiply the total surface area of the greenhouse (step 6) by the temperature difference (step 7) by the overall heat loss coefficient (step 8).

Placement of heating pipes is very important as it is directly related to heat loss; for example, the placement of pipes in the walls resulted in high losses through the sides. Wall pipe coils. Perimeter-wall heating can provide part of the additional heat requirement and contribute to a uniform thermal environment in the greenhouse. Both bare and finned pipe applications are common. Side pipes should have a few centimetres of clearance on all sides to permit the establishment of air currents and should be located low enough to prevent the blockage of light entering through the sidewall. Overhead pipe coils. An overhead coil of pipes across the entire greenhouse results in heat loss through the roof and gables. The overhead coil is not the most desirable source of heat, as it is located above the plants; nevertheless, overhead heating systems can provide the additional heat required for winter months. They can also be used to reduce the risk of Botrytis cinerea outbreak, a major concern for many greenhouse growers In-bed pipe coils. When the greenhouse layout allows it, the in-bed coil is preferable. By placing the heating pipes near the base of the plants, the roots and crown of the plants receive more heat than in the overhead system. Air movement caused by the warmer underbench pipe reduces the humidity around the plant. Heat is also kept lower in the greenhouse resulting in better energy efficiency. Such systems are suitable for plants grown on benches, fixed tables, and rolling or transportable tables. Plate 10 Wall pipes Plate 9 Central boiler (left) and heating pipes for dissipating the produced heat (right) 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 77 Floor pipe coil. Floor heating is more effective than in-bed pipe coil heating. In addition to the advantages of in-bed coils, floor heating has the ability to dry the floor quickly. This is essential when flood floors are used for irrigation/fertilization. In this system, plants are set on the floor, which makes drying the floor difficult. Air movement caused by the warmer floor reduces the humidity around the plant. Such systems are suitable for plants directly grown on the floor, flooded-floor areas or work areas. Pipe/rail heating systems These systems maintain uniform temperatures with a positive effect on the microclimate. Air movement caused by the warmer pipe/rail reduces humidity around the plant. Such systems are suitable for vegetable production (Plate 11). Radiant heater systems These heaters emit infrared radiation, which travels in a straight path at the speed of light. The air through which the radiation travels is not heated. After objects such as plants, walks and benches have been heated, they will warm the air surrounding them. Air temperatures in infrared-radiant-heated greenhouses can be 3–6 °C cooler than in conventionally heated greenhouses with equivalent plant growth. Grower reports on fuel savings suggest a 30–50 percent fuel reduction with the use of low energy infrared-radiant heaters, as compared with the unit heater system. Thermostats and controls Various thermostat and environmental controllers are available for commercial greenhouse production. Sensing devices should be placed at plant level in the greenhouse: thermostats at eye level are easy to read but do not provide the necessary input for optimum environmental control. An appropriate number of sensors are needed throughout the production area. Environmental conditions can vary significantly within a small distance.

Although it may never actually be used, even if it is needed for just one critical cold night, it becomes a highly profitable investment. A minimum of 1 kW of generator capacity is required per 200 m2 of greenhouse floor area. Heating for antifrost protection Heating can be used to protect crops from freezing. It can also keep the greenhouse air temperature at levels above critical thresholds for condensation control. When not equipped with heavy and complicated heating systems, a unit heater is usually enough. Listed below are other useful recommendations for heating a greenhouse in order to avoid fruit freezing: • Back the north wall to an existing structure such as a house or outbuilding for additional wind protection and insulation. • Use water to store heat (a simple passive solar heating system): barrels or plastic tubes filled with water inside the greenhouse capture the sun’s heat, which is then released at night when temperatures drop. • Insulate the greenhouse; insulate plastic greenhouses with a foam sheet – easily placed over the structure at night and removed during the day; install an additional layer of plastic to the interior of the greenhouse for added insulation. 4.

CO2 enrichment is essential to increase quality of produce; indeed, continuous or periodical increase of CO2 inside the greenhouse may lead to an increase of over 20 percent in fruit production for both dry and fresh matter (Shanchez-Guerrero et al., 2005). Better control of the greenhouse aerial environment can improve marketable yield and quality, and extend the growing season (Baille, 1999). Inside an unenriched greenhouse, the CO2 concentration drops below the atmospheric level whenever the CO2 consumption rate by photosynthesis is greater than the supply rate through the greenhouse vents. The poor efficiency of ventilation systems in low-cost greenhouses in Mediterranean countries, coupled with the use of insect-proof nets (Muñoz et al., 1999), explains the relatively high CO2 depletion (about 20% or more) reported in southern Spain (Lorenzo et al., 1990). Possible solutions are: • increase the ventilation rate through forced air; • improve design and management of the ventilation system; or • provide CO2 enrichment. The latter is widely adopted in the greenhouse industry in northern Europe to enhance crop photosynthesis under the low radiation conditions that prevail during winter. Enrichment reportedly increases crop yield and quality under a CO2 concentration of 700–900 μmol mol-1 (Nederhoff, 1994). An important constraint is the short time period available for the efficient use of CO2 enrichment, due to the need to ventilate for temperature control (Enoch, 1984). The fact that greenhouses have to be ventilated during a large part of the day makes it uneconomical to maintain a high CO2 concentration during the day. Heating – GAP recommendations • Keep a backup heating plan in case heater fails. • Do not over seal the greenhouse in winter: bad ventilation leads to humidity problems. • Have a weather station that serves as a greenhouse internal temperature monitor. • Buy and use a thermostat to maintain the constant minimum temperature in your greenhouse. • Use greenhouse fans to circulate the heat from greenhouse ceiling to floor. • Install an alarm system for fire, smoke and CO2 buildup. • Replace greenhouses after 15–20 years (depending on the type of structure, materials used and climate control equipment). 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 81 However, some authors advise supplying CO2 even when ventilation is operating (Nederhoff, 1994) in order to maintain the same CO2 concentration both in the greenhouse and outside, enriching to levels of about 700–800 μmol mol-1 when the greenhouse is kept closed (usually in the early morning and the late afternoon). In the absence of artificial supplies of carbon dioxide in the greenhouse environment, the CO2 absorbed during photosynthesis must ultimately come from the external environment through the ventilation openings. The concentration of CO2 within the greenhouse must be lower than that outside in order to obtain inward flow. Since potential assimilation is heavily dependent on carbon dioxide concentration, assimilation is reduced, whatever the light level or crop status. The ventilation of the greenhouse implies a trade-off between ensuring inflow of CO2 and maintaining an adequate temperature within the greenhouse, particularly during sunny days. Stanghellini et al. (2008) applied a simple model for estimating potential production loss, using data obtained in commercial greenhouses in Almería, Spain, and Sicily, Italy. They analysed the cost, potential benefits and consequences of bringing more CO2 into the greenhouse: either through increased ventilation, at the cost of lowering temperature, or through artificial supply. They found that while the reduction in production caused by depletion is comparable to the reduction resulting from lower temperatures caused by ventilation to avoid depletion, compensating the effect of depletion is much cheaper than making up the loss by heating. Optimal CO2 enrichment depends on the margin between the increase in crop value and the cost of providing the CO2. Attempting to establish the optimal concentration by experiment is not feasible because the economic value of enrichment is not constant but varies with solar radiation through photosynthesis rate, and with greenhouse ventilation rate through loss of CO2 (Bailey and Chalabi, 1994). The optimal CO2 setpoint depends on several influences: the effect of CO2 on the photosynthetic assimilation rate, the partitioning to fruit and to vegetative structure, the distribution of photosynthate in subsequent harvests, and", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The principal source of CO2 enrichment in the greenhouse used to be pure gas; nowadays more frequent use is made of the combustion gases from a hydrocarbon fuel, for example, low sulphur paraffin, propane, butane or natural gas and more recently also from biogas. In these cases, attention should be given to monitoring the SO2, SO3 and NOx levels, which can damage the crops even at very low concentrations. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 82 Dehumidification Condensation refers to the formation of drops of water from water vapour. Condensation occurs when warm, moist air in a greenhouse comes into contact with a cold surface such as glass, fibreglass, plastic or structural members. The air in contact with the cold surface is cooled to the surface temperature. If the surface temperature is below the dew point temperature of the air, the vapour in the air will condense onto the surface. Condensation is heaviest in greenhouses from sunset to several hours after sunrise. During daylight hours, there is sufficient heating from solar radiation to minimize or prevent condensation, except on very cold, cloudy days. Greenhouses are most likely to experience heavy condensation at sunrise or shortly before. Condensation is a symptom of high humidity and can cause significant problems (e.g. germination of fungal pathogen spores, including Botrytis and powdery mildew.) Condensation can be a major problem – at certain times of the year, impossible to avoid entirely. How to dehumidify the greenhouse Combined used of heating and ventilation A common dehumidification practice is simply to open the windows, allowing moist greenhouse air to be replaced by relatively dry outside air. This method does not consume any energy when excess heat is available in the greenhouse and ventilation is needed to reduce the greenhouse temperature. However, when the ventilation required to reduce the temperature is less than that needed to remove moisture from the air, dehumidification consumes energy. Warm greenhouse air is replaced by cold dry outside air, lowering the temperature in the greenhouse. Absorption using hygroscopic material There has been little research on the application of hygroscopic dehumidification in greenhouses, because installation is complex and the use of chemicals is not favourable. During the process, moist greenhouse air comes into contact with the hygroscopic material, releasing the latent heat of vaporization as water vapour is absorbed. The hygroscopic material has to be regenerated at a higher temperature level. A maximum of 90 percent of the energy supplied to the material for regeneration can be returned to the greenhouse air with a sophisticated system involving several heat exchange processes including condensation of the vapour produced in the regeneration process. Condensation on cold surfaces Wet humid air is forced to a cold surface located inside the greenhouse and different from the covering material. Condensation occurs on the cold surface, the water is collected and can be reused, and the absolute humidity of the wet greenhouse air is reduced. One metre of finned pipe used at a temperature of 5 °C can remove 54 g of vapour per hour from air at a temperature of 20 °C and with 80 percent relative humidity. 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 83 Forced ventilation usually with combined use of a heat exchanger Mechanical ventilation is applied to exchange dry outside air with moist greenhouse air, exchanging heat between the two airflows. Based on the results of Campen et al. (2003), a ventilator capacity of 0.01 m3 s-1 is sufficient for all crops. The energy needed to operate the ventilators is not considered; an experimental study (Speetjens, 2001) showed the energy consumption by the ventilators to be less than 1 percent of the energy saved.

Anti-drop covering materials The use of anti-drop covering materials is an alternative technology for greenhouse dehumidification. “Anti-dripping” films contain special additives which eliminate droplets and form instead a continuous thin layer of water running down the sides. The search for anti-drip cover materials has been mainly focused on the optical properties of the cover materials. When should dehumidification take place? • Dusk: Reduce humidity to 70–80% as night falls to prevent condensation. • Dawn: Reduce humidity to prevent condensation, and jumpstart transpiration as the sun rises. Dehumidification – GAP recommendations • Remove any excess sources of water in the greenhouse. • Open the windows or the door to the greenhouse and allow excess moisture to escape ventilation. • Turn on the greenhouse fan to improve air circulation. • Purchase a humidity controller or a dehumidifier for use in the greenhouse. • Use thermal screens at night to prevent radiative heat loss from plant surfaces. • Place radiant heat sources near the crop to keep plant surfaces slightly warmer than air. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 84 RATIONAL USE OF ENERGY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES Rational energy use is fundamental since energy accounts for a substantial proportion of total production costs. For northwest European conditions with heated greenhouses, annual energy consumption for conditioning is high (1 900 MJ m-2 in Scandinavia). In Mediterranean areas, less energy is used (500– 1 600 MJ m-2), but heating is increasingly adopted to achieve early production and a constant quantitative-qualitative yield, leading to higher energy use. Improved environmental control (e.g. more CO2 supply, additional lighting), intensified production schemes and use of cooling systems all increase energy consumption. Average energy use accounts for 10–30 percent of total production costs, depending on the region. Increase in production per unit of energy (energy efficiency) can be achieved through reduction of energy use and/or improvement of production. The major challenge in greenhouse operation is to find ways to contribute to improved energy efficiency combined with an absolute reduction of the overall energy consumption. The emission of CO2 depends on the total use and type of fossil fuel. For example, when coal is used, CO2 emission is 80–100 kg/MJ; for diesel, 75 kg/MJ; for propane, 65 kg/MJ; while for natural gas it is about 58 kg/MJ. In general, the Mediterranean and north European regions have similar objectives with respect to optimizing production efficiency: • autumn/winter – maximize the radiation quantity and minimize the energy loss; • spring/summer – reduce high temperatures. For rational use of energy (or fossil fuels) and reduction of greenhouse energy consumption, greater investment is required in order to achieve: • efficient use of energy (i.e. amount of product per input of energy); • reduction of energy requirement; and • replacement of fossil fuels by more sustainable sources. Energy-efficient climate control Rational use of energy largely depends on energy-efficient greenhouse environmental control, which requires knowledge of the physiological processes (photosynthesis and transpiration, crop growth and development) in relation to the various environmental factors (temperature, light, humidity and carbon dioxide). However, to achieve the maximum benefits of energy-efficient environmental control, it is essential that the greenhouse itself and the control equipment (heating and ventilation system, CO2 supply, lighting) are properly designed and frequently checked (at least at the start and once during the growth season). For example, optimized designs of pipe heating systems may prevent uneven temperature distribution and subsequent loss of energy and crop production. 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 85 Temperature control Wind-dependent heating One way to substantially reduce energy use is to lower heating temperatures: a 1 °C reduction gives an energy saving of around 10 percent. However, lowering temperature slows down growth and development of most crops and may significantly reduce quality. Thus a lower heating temperature will save energy, but is generally not economically feasible as it results in reduced crop production which is not usually compensated for by the lower energy costs.

However, lowering temperature slows down growth and development of most crops and may significantly reduce quality. Thus a lower heating temperature will save energy, but is generally not economically feasible as it results in reduced crop production which is not usually compensated for by the lower energy costs. A more economic application of reduced heating temperatures is wind-dependent temperature control. Heat losses increase linearly as wind speed increases, therefore, energy can be saved by reducing the heating setpoints when it is windy and compensating for this using increased temperatures at low wind speeds. This method results in energy savings of 5–10 percent. Temperature integration Another option for energy-efficient temperature control is the so-called temperature integration (TI) method. This method is based on the fact that the effect of temperature on crop growth and production depends on the 24-hour average temperature rather than distinct day/night temperatures (de Koning, 1988). However, there are limits to this approach and plants have to be grown within the sub- and supra-optimal temperatures (e.g. tomato: > 15 °C and < 30 °C, and chrysanthemum: > 14 °C and < 24 °C) to prevent reduced quality and/or production levels due to poor fruit or flower development. In southern regions in particular, the TI strategy can be implemented using higher than normal ventilation temperatures to maximize heating due to solar gain and to compensate these temperatures by running lower temperatures at night or on dull days. In general, application of TI leads to higher temperatures during daytime and lower temperatures at night. However, the approach of using higher ventilation setpoints can also be combined with the use of lower day heating setpoints and higher temperatures under thermal screens at night. The aim is to fully exploit solar gain and, when additional heat is required, to add it preferably at night when heat losses are limited due to the closed thermal screen. There are potential energy savings of up to 20 percent; Rijsdijk and Vogelezang (2000) demonstrated an 18 percent energy saving in pot plants, rose and sweet pepper with a band width of 8 °C. However, when setting band widths for temperature integration, a balance must be found between maximizing energy savings and minimizing detrimental effects on yield or quality. The balance varies enormously depending on the crop, so specific crop knowledge is required. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 86 Humidity control On a year round basis, a major fraction of the energy transfer from the greenhouse to the environment is by natural ventilation. Under relatively low radiation and moderate ambient temperatures, natural or forced ventilation is generally used to prevent high humidity. Consequently a substantial fraction (5–20%) of the total energy consumption is related to humidity control. Although high humidity is generally associated with increased risk of fungal diseases and reduced quality (e.g. Botrytis, blossom end rot), it may also be positive for crop production and quality (Montero, 2006). Reducing the level of humidity of the air is costly as a result of the energy required and should be assessed against the added value of the crop. An increase in the humidity setpoint of 5 percent decreases the energy consumption by approximately 6 percent. To reduce “humidity control related” energy consumption, there are several options: • higher humidity setpoints • reduction of the transpiration level of the crop • active dehumidification with heat recovery Thermal screens Energy-efficient thermal screen control involves achieving a balance between the production and quality effects related to humidity and light, and energy saving.

Greenhouse climate control and energy use 87 removing old leaves in tomatoes resulted in a 30 percent reduction in transpiration with no detrimental effect on crop yields (Adams et al., 2002). Crop-based environmental control Operational control should not aim at individual environmental factors (temperature, humidity, CO2) but at energy-efficient crop production and quality control, taking into account the impact of control actions on both crop production and energy consumption. While this (model-based) approach has been under research since the early 1980s, its practical application in on-line control of greenhouses remains limited because it requires the end- user to adopt an entirely new approach and abandon current practices.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 88 Rational energy use in practice While the introduction of new innovative environmental control technologies will increase energy efficiency, major advances can be made by improving the hardware design of heating and ventilation systems and increasing the accuracy and the frequency of controls of the sensor network. Thus, the major practical recommendations for rational energy use largely depend on the grower’s operational control of the available hardware in terms of heating, ventilation and cooling systems, screens etc. Energy saving: reduction of greenhouse energy requirement Covering materials and screens Most energy loss in natural ventilated greenhouses occurs through: • convection and radiation from the greenhouse cover; and • sensible and latent heat transfer through ventilation. Improved insulation and reduced ventilation are therefore the first steps towards creating energy-conserving greenhouses. The basis of energy reduction is good maintenance of greenhouse hardware (doors, cover, sidewalls, foundation). Measures must be taken to prevent unnecessary air leakage from the greenhouse: keeping greenhouse doors closed, sealing air leakages, repair of broken cover material and sidewalls, and uniform closure of natural ventilators. Increasing the insulation value of the greenhouse has a major impact on energy consumption as most energy loss takes place through the cover. Therefore different technologies can be applied, including increase of the insulation value using double or triple layer materials and application of coatings to reduce radiation loss. A combination of these techniques may lead to a significant reduction in energy use for the entire greenhouse system (Table 2).

In practice, the potential energy saving of double and triple covering materials is rarely achieved, since the grower will try to compensate for the higher humidity levels by increasing the dehumidification of the greenhouse environment. For energy conservative (film) greenhouses, materials combining high light transmission with low IR transmission are preferred (Hemming, 2005).

Screens A thermal screen adds an additional barrier between the greenhouse and its surroundings and reduces both convection and ventilation loss. Screens can be either fixed or movable. Fixed screens are normally used during the early growth stage and production period of the crop, but the constant reduction of the light level and increased humidity limit the period of application and consequently the potential energy saving. Movable screens have less impact on light transmission than fixed screens or double covering materials. Screens may reduce energy use by more than 35–40 percent, depending on the material (Table 4). In practice, movable screens are closed for only part of the entire 24-hour period depending on the grower’s criteria for opening and closing, which are generally related to humidity and light levels.

For southern regions the application of screens (and energy- saving covering material) may be less economically feasible. Due to the general lower energy use (see Figure 4) the financial benefits of savings will be less while investments remain relatively high. Energy-efficient cooling Ventilation In almost all regions worldwide, and especially at southern latitudes, there is a large surplus of solar energy requiring efficient cooling systems to reduce the air temperature. Natural ventilation is the most common method of cooling, and optimizing the geometry of the greenhouse can enhance natural ventilation. With a roof slope of up to 30°, the ventilation rate significantly increases and traditional horizontal roof greenhouses are replaced with symmetrical or asymmetrical greenhouses. Windward ventilation is more efficient than leeward ventilation, so new greenhouse constructions have larger openings facing the prevailing winds.

In southern regions in particular, movable and external shading are very efficient at improving energy efficiency. Specific materials which absorb or reflect different wavelengths or contain interference or photo or thermochromic pigments may be used to bring down the heat load but mostly these materials also reduce the PAR level. Materials reflecting part of the sun’s energy not necessary for plant growth (near-infrared, NIR) show promising results (e.g. Garciá-Alonso et al., 2006) and may be applied either as greenhouse cover or as screen material. Mechanical cooling Mechanical cooling (fans, heat pumps and heat exchangers) can maintain the same greenhouse temperature as does natural ventilation; it can further reduce the temperature, especially under high ambient temperatures or high radiation levels. With high cooling capacity it is possible to keep the greenhouse completely closed, even at maximum radiation levels. However, all practical and experimental experience shows that return on investment for these systems is poor for all regions in the world, except for direct evaporative cooling by fogging/misting and indirect evaporative cooling (pad and fan). This is most likely the result of the positive effects of lower temperature and higher humidity resulting in better growth and production, at least with major 4. Greenhouse climate control and energy use 91 fruit and vegetables. Therefore, direct evaporative cooling by misting and pad and fan cooling still gives the best economic results and increases energy efficiency primarily through the impact on production. Energy reduction in practice The reduction of the energy requirement is related to the grower’s strategic choices in relation to greenhouse construction, covering material and environmental equipment in terms of heating system, ventilation, cooling, screens etc. Increased investment is required and needs to be considered in terms of return on investments. Replacement of fossil fuel by other sustainable sources As CO2 emission is directly related to the use of fossil fuels for heating and cooling greenhouses, alternatives (e.g. solar and geothermal energy, biomass and waste heat) can significantly help achieve the reduced CO2 emission targets. Using waste heat and CO2 supply from combined heat and power generators (CHP) and feeding the electricity to the national grid can save a significant fraction of fossil fuel. While energy is not directly saved at greenhouse level, CHP reduces CO2 emission at national level by reducing the CO2 emission of the central power plants. However, the economically feasible application of CHP largely depends on the local situation. Sometimes it is not allowed or is not technically feasible to feed electricity into the national grid, or the price of electricity is (too) low. Stand- alone use of CHP (for electricity used at greenhouse farm level) is only an option Energy efficiency – GAP recommendations • Take care of regular maintenance of the greenhouse hardware (doors, cover, sidewalls, foundation, ventilators, pad/fan, screen material etc.). • Keep doors closed, seal air leakages, replace broken cover material and ripped screens. • Select greenhouse cover materials with low IR transmission. • Use (moveable) thermal screens for areas with low average or low night temperatures. • Use thermal screens in particular in locations characterized by clear sky to reduce radiative heat exchange with the sky canopy. • Replace horizontal roof greenhouses with symmetrical or asymmetrical greenhouses with roof slopes up to 30°. • When using natural ventilation, build greenhouses with large windward ventilation openings located in line with the prevailing wind direction. • If cooling is required, use misting or pad and fan cooling; if not sufficient, add a shading screen. • Replace old greenhouses with newer more energy-efficient models.

Biomass and anaerobic digestion are good alternatives for fossil fuel but the availability and massive quantities needed and uncertainty about the energy content are major drawbacks for large-scale application. For example, a 1-MW biomass source may require up to 2 500 tonnes of dry mass per year. This not only requires significant investments but also logistic solutions and the availability of this biomass in the surrounding area. Furthermore, the continuity of the biomass supply may be a problem as the storage of required amounts of gas is almost impossible. With regard to CO2 from this gas, special attention should be paid to pollution aspects after burning components like SO2/SO3 and NOx may seriously damage the crop. However, for small-scale application and stand-alone greenhouses without connection to energy infrastructure, it may be a valid option. Depending on the geology of the area, geothermal energy (water temperatures > 60 °C) is a promising alternative. Large (volcanic) areas in the world (e.g. Turkey) have geothermal potential which can be economically feasible for greenhouse heating but so far the number of geothermal heated greenhouses is limited, primarily because of the high financial risks related to drilling the hot water well. In the Netherlands a geothermal source (water 65 °C, depth 1 700 m) for greenhouse heating required an investment of about € 5.5 million (price level 2007). The total costs, however, can differ greatly as in other areas of the world geothermal energy is available at lesser depths. For the economic application of deep geothermal energy, in general a large greenhouse area (> 20 ha) has to be connected to the source. Sustainable energy resources – GAP recommendations The use of alternative energy sources depends on the strategic and long-term choices of the grower and usually becomes relevant if previous steps have led to a reduction in the required energy input per unit of area. Although all previous recommendations also have to be considered from the point of view of economic feasibility, this last step requires specific attention to risk analysis concerning the reliability of availability/delivery of the alternative source and its price fluctuations since in general the investment costs related to this step are generally (very) high. For economic reasons (economy of scale), application of more sustainable energy sources generally requires connection to a large greenhouse area. It is therefore recommended to use specialized consultants and advisory services when considering the use of these sustainable energy sources. 4.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 98 The market is, in most cases, the limiting factor in intensive year-round productions: high yields may be obtained with optimal control of the climatic conditions in a greenhouse, but they may not meet market requirements (offer does not match demand). Although economic factors (markets) and political decisions (subsidies for certain crops in specific areas) may have a substantial impact on crop choice, the focus herein is on the options for specific greenhouse agrosystems, often closely linked to the agro-environmental constraints. Cultivar choice also depends on the type of farm: medium- and large-scale farms may sell their products in national and international markets, while small-scale farms produce to fulfil the family’s needs or for limited profits in local markets. Compared with open-field cultivations, greenhouse technologies enable the cultivation of a large number of species in a specific geographic area since they reproduce, in a controlled environment, climatic conditions optimal for certain species, regardless of the external environment. The cost/benefit ratio is a major factor determining the level of technology implemented in greenhouse systems which indirectly reflects the current geographical distribution of greenhouse typologies: more isolated (heated, closed and semi-closed) in central/northern Europe; less isolated (cold, open or semi-open) in southern Europe and the Mediterranean. This is an important consideration when choosing crops and cultivars since, for the same species, different cultivars may adapt well to specific cultural conditions and protected environments. While cut flowers, ornamentals and fruit crops may be important under protected cultivation, this chapter concentrates on vegetable crops, including new crops and product diversification, given that the crops currently grown tend to be limited to a relatively small number of species and cultivars. CHOICE OF THE CROP Under mild winter climatic conditions, cold greenhouses and protected cultivations concentrate on vegetable productions belonging to the Solanaceae (tomato, pepper, eggplant) and Cucurbitaceae (melon, summer squash, watermelon, cucumber) families. These crops (accounting for > 80% of the protected area in most Mediterranean countries) suit cold greenhouse conditions and meet local market requirements. Their success in protected cultivation is due to: • wide consumption; • good adaption to unsteady climatic conditions inside cold greenhouses as a result of the crops’ indeterminate growth habits; and • long cultivation cycles (more continuous use of greenhouses during the year). Leafy determinate plants, on the other hand, do not share the above characteristics, and may therefore encounter problems related to bolting control, with effects on yield and product quality. 5. Choice of species and cultivars for protected cultivation 99 From an economic point of view, it should be noted that greenhouse vegetable productions in Mediterranean areas are constantly increasing (Tuzel and Leonardi, 2009), while growers’ incomes are decreasing, despite efforts to lower production costs and improve competitivity (La Malfa and Leonardi, 2001). Crop choice may become increasingly important to preserve the economic sustainability of the established greenhouse industry and improve the performance of farms introducing protected cultivations in new areas.

In all cases, considering the increasing production costs and the short shelf-life of vegetable products, crop choice should guarantee an optimal match between production and timing of delivery to the market. The economic considerations concern the relationship between market prices and farmers’ returns. Production costs are not fixed: for example, labour in Mediterranean countries can vary from a factor of 1 to 8. Fertilizers, pesticides and transportation also vary enormously in cost. When farmers intend to produce for local markets, it may be possible to reduce transportation costs adopting alternative solutions such as pick-your-own, roadside markets or arrangements with local grocery stores. However, these systems are not common in greenhouse cultivation, which mostly relies on centralized market distribution or arrangements with supermarkets and supermarket chains. The availability of cold storage rooms on the farm (or close by) is useful – even critical – for preserving the quality of perishable products before transportation. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 100 In addition to the physical compatibility between crop and shelter (e.g. tunnel size and height of vertically trained plants), there are other specific crop requirements to be considered. In general, the greater the climatic requirements, the lower the compatibility with the protective shelters most utilized in mild winter climates. The labour requirements, as well as labour availability during the growing cycle, should be considered. In particular in small (family) farms, the time and labour required for a specific crop should not be underestimated, and, if possible, the requirement should be calculated in advance. Furthermore, some tasks may require different levels of specialization requiring additional investments in training or technological equipment (e.g. fertigation units for hydroponic systems). With regard to the external conditions, protected cultivation can be in a wide variety of situations. Greenhouses are located in different climates, however with a higher concentration in areas were the winter is mild and places where climatic risks are low; but there has been expansion to areas with significant climatic risks. Moreover, under protected cultivation in mild winter climates, the greenhouse building characteristics and the frequent total absence of active climate control have a major effect on the microclimate (Baille, 2001). Therefore, when farmers rely on very simple structures for crop protection, it is essential to choose a species that suits the specific climatic conditions while having moderate control of the growth environment (e.g. tomato vs pepper). CHOICE OF THE CULTIVAR Greenhouse production is a very dynamic economic sector and must cope with rapid changes in market trends and consumer preferences. Consequently, choosing the right cultivar in greenhouse production is a critical stage in the production process (Tuzel and Leonardi, 2009). Cultivar choice is important for each crop and specific produce typology. Cultivars which produce fruits with varying characteristics are not valid alternatives in the greenhouse production system which must respond to strict production and market requirements. Cultivars for protected cultivation differ quite substantially from those used in open-field vegetable productions: they are less exposed to environmental constraints and consequently can better express their yield potential. However, different cultivar-specific requirements may also exist depending on the level of technology used in protected cultivation (e.g. cultivars adapted for long-cycle crops). In the past, production strategies in Mediterranean greenhouses have been based on adapting crops to a suboptimal environment due to limited greenhouse climate control. Over the years greenhouse climate control systems have been developed, resulting in greatly improved yield and product quality (Castilla et al., 2004). 5. Choice of species and cultivars for protected cultivation 101 A range of factors may condition the choice of one cultivar over another and growers, traders and consumers have different perspectives. For example, for growers, potential yield, extended harvesting time with constant product quality, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses are major considerations. Cultivars resistant to major pathogens and pests have been introduced in protected cultivation and increasingly represent an important component of the production process (Tuzel and Leonardi, 2009). The introduction of stress-tolerant cultivars allows a significant reduction in chemical treatments, environmental pollution and production costs, while providing new possibilities for the implementation of integrated cultivation", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Cultivars resistant to major pathogens and pests have been introduced in protected cultivation and increasingly represent an important component of the production process (Tuzel and Leonardi, 2009). The introduction of stress-tolerant cultivars allows a significant reduction in chemical treatments, environmental pollution and production costs, while providing new possibilities for the implementation of integrated cultivation processes and greenhouse organic productions. However, when adopting resistant cultivars, it is necessary to consider the stability of the specific resistance under different microclimatic and agronomic conditions. With particular fruit typologies (e.g. local cultivars), resistance to soil-borne diseases is not a necessary requirement, since it can be overcome by using suitable rootstocks and well-developed grafting techniques; the genotype should be chosen together with a suitable rootstock (with specific resistance and high affinity with the scion) (Leonardi and Romano, 2004). For the trader, long shelf-life and any characteristic that makes the product unique and highly appreciated (hence, requested) by consumers are important factors. For the consumer, the product must be easy-to-use, versatile, with good taste and health properties. Cultivar choice should theoretically take into account all the above aspects, but in practice, different priorities are defined by growers in relation to product destination and specific market targets. It is important to choose cultivars that in specific areas may valorize the environmental conditions and technical factors involved in the production process. Recent advancement due to rapidly developing breeding technologies has led to a substantially broader portfolio of new cultivars with genetic traits for improved disease resistance, adaptability to suboptimal temperature and light, and other specific traits, such as partenocarpy and suitability for grafting. In addition to standard quality parameters (size, colour, Brix, % dry matter, shelf-life etc.), particular attention has been given to qualitative traits defining the nutritional profile of fresh fruits and vegetables (Lenucci et al., 2006). While the above-mentioned traits are all important in greenhouse production, it is fundamental to assess their responsiveness under different conditions in the specific growing area. This is not an easy task since the high renovation rate of the available cultivars and the lack of systematic experimentation of agronomic performances mean that there are no reliable data to provide useful information to the farmers. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 102 Given the multiple qualities a cultivar is expected to have, seed and breeding companies strive to respond to market requirements and broaden the portfolio of cultivars. In addition, there are legal, regulatory and certification requirements with regard to product quality and safety, as well as restrictions on chemicals used in agricultural production (Leonardi, 2005), all of which increase the pressure for the selection of high quality cultivars capable of tolerating most common greenhouse pests and diseases. At the same time, seed companies tend to impose their selections on the market with a consequent reduction in germplasm diversity and unavoidable loss of important and valuable genetic traits. Systematic coordinated breeding programmes to preserve local genetic resources adapted to specific environments are needed to capitalize on, valorize and maintain biodiversity. It is important to develop, in a representative greenhouse area, a local screening programme to evaluate and assess recently released cultivars (with the support of local administrations and research institutions), in order to assist farmers and endorse the innovation of vegetable cultivars in parallel with standard activities developed by seed and breeding companies (Williams and Roberts, 2002). An extension programme of this kind should also provide technical advice to farmers on cultural aspects to reach the yield and quality potential of specific species. The feed-forward-feed-back loop between farmers, extension services and seed companies may generate an effective system to preserve and valorize underexploited genetic resources. TRADITIONAL VERSUS INNOVATIVE GREENHOUSE PRODUCTIONS In greenhouse cultivations, more than in other agrosystems, there is increasing interest in crop diversification with a view to preserving the economic sustainability of the established greenhouse industry and improving the performance of farmers who have introduced protected cultivations in new areas (La Malfa and Leonardi, 1993). The identification of new crops for introduction into farming systems is an important aspect of the economic sustainability of protected cultivations.

The identification of new crops for introduction into farming systems is an important aspect of the economic sustainability of protected cultivations. In addition to the fundamental requisites of adaptation to cold greenhouse conditions, they should guarantee an economic return, which must be competitive with that obtained with other crops. Results from an EU research project in the 1990s, involving several European countries, highlighted the potential of some speciality crops (La Malfa et al., 1996), including crops grown on small acreage, ethnic vegetables, gourmet vegetables, miniature vegetables and vegetables absent or rare in certain areas (Table 1). The importance of speciality vegetables has increased substantially in recent years (Maynard, 2002). 5. Choice of species and cultivars for protected cultivation 103 There are other new crops (e.g. okra, orach, rocket, asparagus, lettuce) which give satisfactory agronomic results but market demand remains somewhat limited. The most significant example of diversification paradoxically concerns a well- established crop: tomato (La Malfa et al., 1996). By capitalizing on its genetic intraspecific diversity, new crops have been established in recent decades to produce new fruit typologies. In Italy, cherry and cluster tomatoes were quite rare 20 years ago and now represent more than 50 percent of greenhouse production. Crop diversification, obtained by growing new species or varieties and in some cases new cultivars, is important for the sustainability of the entire production process. The introduction of new crops could compensate product losses resulting from unexpected biotic or abiotic stresses, or from market fluctuations, and enhances overall agrosystem stability. An increasingly important issue in this respect is the use of transgenic cultivars capable of adding valuable traits to greenhouse crops. Although still under debate, the use of transgene technology TABLE 1 Some of the new crops exploited in cold greenhouses in the Mediterranean area: global scoring of crops and some of the main traits relative to the plant or to the product as recorded in cold greenhouse cultivation Crops Scoring Traits Asparagus ** Short rest period; earliness; spear quality Asparagus lettuce * Shortness of cycle; fibre content of the stem; low success rate with consumers Bottle gourd *** Bulky plant; difficulties in crop management; fruit well accepted Carosello * Disease susceptibility; earliness; irregular shape and size of fruits; good taste Chinese cabbage *** Bolting, shortness of cycle; good taste; product well accepted Okra * Low harvest index; frost susceptibility; narrow market; low productive level Orach *** High yield level; short shelf-life; good taste Pak choi ** Bolting; high yield level; high fibre content Parthenocarpic tomato and eggplant *** Setting at low temperature; irregular fruit shape and size Radish ** Shortness of cycle; cracking of the roots; frequent pungency taste Rocket ** Shortness of cycle; bolting; low fibre content Snake melon *** Earliness; irregular fruit; no bitter taste Sweet corn *** Irregular setting; bulky plant Vigna spp. ** High cost of harvesting; short shelf-life Water spinach ** Frost damage; high growth rate, good taste Wild beet *** High-yielding; high mineral and vitamin content Wild borage * High growth rate; high mineral and vitamin content Wild cabbage * Bolting; high growth rate; high mineral and vitamin content Wild chicory * Slow growth rate; resistance to bolting; satisfactory yield level and quality * = poor; ** = fair; *** = good.

However, it is unlikely that crop diversification in Mediterranean cold greenhouses will reach the level of heated greenhouses. Leaving aside the economic factor, a heated greenhouse can be climatically adapted to nearly any plant requirement, while in unheated greenhouses, plants must adapt to an internal environment which depends on the external climatic conditions. Considering only the biological requirements of new crops, cold greenhouses should be used for mesophytic plants (La Malfa and Leonardi, 2001).

The photothermic requirements of these species should not be too high, so they can be met through simple modifications of internal microclimatic conditions; however, they should not be so low that they reduce or nullify the advantages of the greenhouse environment in terms of productivity, quality and harvest period. For these environments, new crops have to withstand widely variable thermal ranges on a daily and seasonal basis. The minimum and maximum temperature levels reached daily in these areas are often outside the thermokinetic window, i.e. the thermal interval suitable for biological processes. Moreover, this interval is not always well known for new candidate crops. A greenhouse should produce the maximum favourable effects on plants with a long cycle and indefinite growth, in order to achieve more intensive greenhouse utilization. In addition to the plant characteristics, other factors are be considered when choosing new crops: organizational aspects (e.g. using the greenhouse also during summer rest periods) and marketing reasons (e.g. improving quality or extending the supply period). Diversification in a cold greenhouse is, therefore, rather limited despite the high interspecific and intraspecific variability of vegetable plants (hundreds of species in the Mediterranean Basin alone). On the basis of this analysis, it can be concluded that the requisites of a candidate new crop for Mediterranean cold greenhouses differ in terms of shelter typology. In contrast, in the Netherlands, for heated greenhouses, the principal requisites for new crops are: year-round cultivation, adaptation to soilless culture and to heating, high yield potential, low labour requirements, high thermal requirements (making open-air cultivation impossible) and high quality compared with open-air products. All other considerations – production costs, product quality, and overlapping with other open-air crops in the production calendar – are valid for heated and unheated greenhouses. At global level, more than 1 000 species are consumed as “vegetables”. There are several sources of new crops introduced in greenhouse productions: • species introduced from other countries; • minor species and varieties cultivated in the past, and now overlooked or not systematically cultivated; 5. Choice of species and cultivars for protected cultivation 105 • cultivars of species already widely cultivated in greenhouses but capable of supplying vegetables with new characteristics; • species to date cultivated only in the open air; and • wild species, eaten as vegetables. In summary new crops should: • adapt to agroclimatic and social conditions; • meet consumer requirements; and • be marketable and profitable. Innovative crops allied to traditional ones and capable of producing new vegetable typologies include: cherry tomato (20 years ago), beef tomato (recently), immature pea pods, small eggplants, small peppers, small strawberries, yellow and variegated green bean pods and yellow courgettes. These should be considered new to certain areas (in the Mediterranean), although they may already be well known elsewhere. The market is certainly a major driving factor for the introduction of a new crop. Seedless watermelons have been a successful innovation with widespread consumption. In other cases, a particular product, such as gombo (Abelmoscus esculentum), may not be widely distributed, but it responds to a very specific consumer demand (in this case from Asia and Africa). The potential of new crops depends on the market opportunities. Diversification could therefore be aimed at producing relatively small quantities of a particular product if it is targeted towards a specific market. Unfortunately, there is not sufficient monitoring and information on new crops introduced in standard greenhouse farming systems to compile a database to be used as a guideline. This also hinders further expansion of these crops and possible developments of up-to- date cultural techniques.

GAP recommendations • Take into consideration the general agro-environmental criteria for choosing species and cultivars in a given environment. These include species-specific physiological needs in terms of light, temperature, humidity and soil characteristics. • Validate the specific choice of crops and cultivars in the economic context. • Organize specific training programmes to extend knowledge of agro-techniques specific to certain crops. • Develop technical training in parallel with micro-economy training to implement socio- economic variables and market trends in the overall assessment of economic convenience. • Consider the advantages and disadvantages of diversification compared with specialization on a case-by-case basis. • Adopt a coordinated programme for crop diversification and introduction of new species or cultivars, to valorize and capitalize on available labour, technical specialization, environmental parameters and socio-economic constraints in a specific area (avoid initiatives by single growers). • Although greenhouse cultivation is flexible, take into account for the overall farm economy that the introduction of new crops requires time to put in place the fully operative pipeline from production to consumption. • Do not limit a cost-benefit analysis to agronomic evaluation; socio-economic parameters and time are critical variables. • To implement these fundamental principles, a systematic approach based on the involvement of different actors is necessary for an effective and successful decision process.

Fernández b a Department of Agronomy, University of Almería, Spain b Research Station Las Palmerillas of the Cajamar Cajar Rural, Almería, Spain INTRODUCTION Large areas of unheated greenhouses are located in the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Basin (Pardossi et al., 2004). These are generally relatively low- cost structures covered with plastic, without active climatic control systems, in which drip irrigation is used with soil-grown or substrate-grown crops (Castilla et al., 2004; Pardossi et al., 2004; Castilla and Hernández, 2005). These relatively simple greenhouses are known collectively as Mediterranean greenhouses, and they are most commonly used for vegetable crop production. Characterization of the greenhouses, growing conditions, vegetable species grown and management practices have been reported (Castilla et al., 2004; Pardossi et al., 2004; Castilla and Hernández, 2005). The largest area of Mediterranean greenhouses is located on the southeast (SE) coast of Spain; the major cropping cycles in this region and the crops grown are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Major cropping cycles and the vegetable species grown in Mediterranean greenhouses in Almería, SE Spain Major cycles Typical period of cycle Crops grown Autumn–spring August–May Tomato, eggplant Summer/autumn–winter July/Aug./Sept.–Jan./Feb. Pepper, tomato, cucumber, zucchini Spring–summer Jan./Feb./Mar.–May/June Melon,a watermelon,a tomato, cucumber, zucchini a Cooling with whitewash not used during warm periods with these species. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 110 In these generally dry Mediterranean regions, water is relatively scarce and is often subject to increasing competition from housing and tourism. Also, local water resources are often detrimentally affected by irrigated greenhouse horticulture which causes various problems, including overexploitation, nitrate contamination and salinization of aquifers. Consequently, there is considerable and increasing pressure to optimize irrigation management and ensure optimal production and economic returns, and to avoid environmentally harmful excessive irrigation applications. Five aspects of irrigation of vegetable crops in Mediterranean greenhouses are covered herein: • crop water requirements • characterization of the amounts of water used and current irrigation practices • irrigation scheduling of soil-grown crops • irrigation scheduling of substrate-grown crops • water-use efficiency Much of the data presented are from SE Spain, which has the largest greenhouse area dedicated to intensive vegetable production in the Mediterranean Basin and one of the highest concentrations of greenhouses in the world. A considerable amount of scientific and technical information has been produced in this region during the last 15 years regarding water use and irrigation management of greenhouse-grown vegetable crops. This section focuses on soil-grown crops, while irrigation in substrate-grown crops is considered in a more general manner. Plate 1 Aerial view of plastic greenhouses in Almería, Spain Plate 2 Examples of plastic greenhouses in Almería 6. Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 111 WATER REQUIREMENTS OF MEDITERRANEAN GREENHOUSE CROPS Components of crop water requirements within greenhouses Crop water requirement is the total volume of water that a crop needs to maintain maximum rates of crop evapotranspiration (ETc); it is calculated as the difference between ETc and water obtained from rainfall and soil water. Technically, the water required to maintain ETc is the “net” crop water requirement, with the “gross” crop water requirement taking into account extra irrigation to consider salinity and application uniformity. In this section, crop water requirements are “net” crop water requirements. Since no rainfall enters greenhouses and seasonal soil water extraction is negligible (Fernández et al., 2005), because the soil is continuously close to field capacity from high frequency drip irrigation, it can generally be assumed that the crop water requirement of greenhouse-grown crops is equivalent to ETc. Crop evapotranspiration of Mediterranean greenhouse crops The ETc of major vegetable crops grown in soil in unheated plastic greenhouses in the Mediterranean Basin has been determined (Table 2). Many of these data were obtained using drainage lysimeters in Almería, SE Spain (e.g. Orgaz et al., 2005). Seasonal crop water requirements (i.e. ETc) determined in Almería range from 170 to 371 mm (Table 2). The lowest values are generally for spring- grown melon and watermelon crops with 3–4-month growing periods, and the highest values for pepper crops", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The ETc values for substrate-grown crops have been calculated by subtracting drainage from irrigation volumes. Generally, these values are similar to those for equivalent crops grown in soil (Table 2). Reported ETc values for substrate-grown crops are 177 mm for a short cycle autumn–winter tomato crop (Gallardo et al., 2009), 276 mm for short- cycle spring tomato crops (Gallardo et al., 2009), and 308 mm for a summer–winter sweet pepper crop (Rodríguez, 2008). Compared with equivalent vegetable crops grown outdoors with irrigation, the seasonal ETc of greenhouse vegetable crops is appreciably lower due to the reduced evaporative demand inside the greenhouse (Fernández et al., 2010). The evaporative demand is lower inside than outside due to the decrease in solar radiation (40% on average) and the greatly reduced wind speeds of 0.1–0.3 m s-1 or less (Fernández et al., 2010). The evaporative demand inside the greenhouse can be 60 percent of that outside (Fernández et al., 2001; Möller and Assouline, 2007). Additionally, out-of-season vegetable crops are commonly grown in Mediterranean greenhouses during late autumn to early spring, when low evaporative demand contributes to the relatively low values for crop water requirements. In Almería, greenhouse crops are grown in mulched soils known locally as enarenado consisting of an 8–12 cm layer of coarse sand mulch on the soil surface (Castilla and Hernández, 2005); the sand mulch appreciably reduces direct evaporation from the soil surface, further reducing crop water use. Crop evapotranspiration and greenhouse cooling An additional factor contributing to relatively low ETc values in SE Spain is whitewash (suspension of calcium carbonate), commonly applied to the greenhouse roof and walls during warmer periods (summer/early autumn to late autumn; early spring to summer) to decrease air temperature inside the greenhouse. The whitewash reduces the amount of solar radiation entering the greenhouse and therefore also the air temperature; consequently, there is a reduction in ETc which is proportional to the thickness of applied whitewash. The transmissivity to solar radiation of greenhouse plastic cladding is usually about 60%; commonly used whitewash application rates reduce this to 20–30% in July to mid-September, and to approximately 45% in mid-September to mid-October and in late February to late June. Other cooling techniques affecting ETc, such as misting and shading screens, are currently used by only a small percentage of growers in SE Spain (Céspedes et al., 2009). Values for the reduction in radiation and consequently in ETc as a function of applied whitewash are given in Fernández et al. (2001).

Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 113 Determination of crop evapotranspiration for Mediterranean greenhouse crops To determine crop water requirements, the standard FAO methodology (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Allen et al., 1998) has been adapted for use in vegetable crops grown in Mediterranean greenhouses in SE Spain by the Las Palmerillas Research Station of the Cajamar Caja Rural in Almería (Fernández et al., 2001, 2010, 2011; Orgaz et al., 2005; Bonachela et al., 2006). The FAO method estimates crop evapotranspiration (ETc) as the product of: • reference evapotranspiration (ETo), equivalent to the evapotranspiration of a grass crop and which quantifies the effect of climate on crop water demand; and • the crop coefficient (Kc), which quantifies the effect of crop species and stage of development (Allen et al., 1998). Determination of reference evapotranspiration for Mediterranean greenhouse crops Evaluation of various equations to estimate ETo in plastic greenhouses in Mediterranean climate conditions was conducted by Fernández et al. (2010, 2011). A summary of the different equations, calibrated for plastic Mediterranean greenhouses, is presented in Table 3. Allen et al. (1998) recommend the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method as a standard for estimating ETo from climatic data, in both arid and humid climates, using radiation, air temperature, atmospheric humidity and wind velocity data. Inside plastic greenhouses in Mediterranean climate areas, this method accurately estimates ETo compared with a standard grass crop when using a fixed value of aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m-1 (Fernández et al., 2010, 2011; Table 3). The FAO-24 pan evaporation method (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977) with a Kp (pan coefficient) constant of 0.79 provides good estimates of ETo in plastic greenhouses under Mediterranean conditions (Fernández et al., 2010; Table 3). However, the pan evaporation method is not considered practical for greenhouse conditions, as it cannot be readily adjusted to consider variability between greenhouses on account of whitewashing and the age of the plastic cladding (Fernández et al., 2010). In Mediterranean greenhouses, solar radiation is the climatic parameter that most influences evaporative demand (Fernández et al., 2010). In Almería, both Plate 4 Type A evaporation tank located within a grass sward in a greenhouse LAS PALMERILLAS RESEARCH STATION, ALMERÍA GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 114 the Hargreaves equation (Table 3; Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977) and the Almería radiation model (Table 3; Fernández et al., 2010) – developed for these conditions and derived from the FAO-radiation equation (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977) – provide accurate estimation of ETo. Given their limited climatic data requirements and relative simplicity (compared with the Penman-Monteith equation), these two methods are recommended for practical estimation of ETo in plastic greenhouses under Mediterranean climatic conditions (Fernández et al., 2010). The Almería radiation method calculates daily ETo within a greenhouse from values of the daily sum of external solar radiation and the transmissivity (the ratio between inside and outside solar radiation) of the greenhouse cladding. The value of transmissivity depends on greenhouse construction (characteristics of plastic cladding, structure) and management practices used to reduce greenhouse temperature (Bonachela et al., 2006; Fernández et al., 2001, 2009, 2010). The major advantage of the Almería radiation method is that calculation of ETo – and consequently of irrigation requirements – considers relevant characteristics of individual greenhouses, including greenhouse construction (structure, cladding materials, age of plastic etc.) and practical greenhouse management (whitewashing TABLE 3 Recommended equations for estimating ETo inside plastic greenhouses in Mediterranean climatic conditions Method/ equation Equations Calibration values References Penman- Monteith u2=208*ra ra=295 s m-1 Fernández et al.

Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 115 and use of shading materials etc.). In consideration of these factors and given its simplicity and accuracy, the Almería radiation method has been used extensively in Almería for both extension and scientific purposes. Determination of crop coefficient values for Mediterranean greenhouse crops Crop coefficient (Kc) values have been determined for the main greenhouse-grown vegetable crops in Almería (Fernández et al., 2001; Orgaz et al., 2005; Table 4). The Kc values vary according to species, development stage and crop management practices (vertically supported or not). Measured maximum Kc values for crops that are not vertically supported (melon and watermelon) were between 1 and 1.1, similar to measured values for the same crops under open field conditions (Orgaz et al., 2005; Table 4). By contrast, maximum Kc values for vertically supported crops (melon, green beans, tomato and sweet pepper) varied between 1.3 and 1.6 (Table 4), i.e. higher than the values reported for equivalent open field crops (Fernández et al., 2001; Orgaz et al., 2005). The suggested explanation for the relatively high maximum Kc values of supported greenhouse crops is that there is more uniform light penetration within the canopies thereby providing relatively higher ET rates than for unsupported greenhouse crops and open field crops which tend to be shorter with denser canopies (Orgaz et al., 2005). Uniformity of light penetration increases with the following (Orgaz et al., 2005): • tall and open structure of the supported crops • regular pruning forming more open canopies TABLE 4 Crop coefficient (Kc) values determined for the major greenhouse-grown vegetable species in Almería, SE Spain Species Initial Kc Maximum Kc Final Kc a Supported crops Sweet pepper 0.2 1.3 0.9 Tomato 0.2 1.4 1.0 Melon 0.2 1.3 1.1 Cucumber 0.2 1.2 Eggplant 0.2 1.2 0.9 Green beans 0.2 1.4 1.2 Non supported crops Melon 0.2 1.1 1.0 Watermelon 1.1 1.0 Zucchini 0.2 1.1 Values presented are the initial Kc value for transplanted seedlings, maximum Kc values, and final Kc values where appropriate.

In some crops (e.g. melon, green beans) and cropping cycles, following the period of maximum Kc, Kc values can subsequently decrease slightly to lower final Kc values during the latter part of the growing season due to senescence or cold temperature damage to leaves.

Many off-season crops are terminated, for market reasons (low prices), before plants are sufficiently exposed to cold temperatures to induce the reduction from maximum Kc values. For long-cycle crops grown during summer/autumn–spring cycles (e.g. pepper), the linear reduction to final Kc on account of cold temperature damage can be followed by a spring period with constant final Kc values (Orgaz et al., 2005). Examples of seasonal evolution of Kc values for an autumn–summer pepper crop and a spring–summer supported melon crop are presented in Figure 1. In the pepper crop, Figure 1a shows the four major phases referred to previously: • linear increase from initial Kc of 0.2 to maximum Kc of 1.4 • constant maximum Kc • linear decrease from maximum Kc to final Kc • constant final Kc values In the melon crop, following a period of constant initial Kc values, Kc then increased rapidly and almost linearly to reach a maximum Kc value of 1.3, which was maintained until the end of the cycle (Figure 1b).

Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 117 For greenhouse-grown vegetable crops, planting dates and lengths of crop cycles can vary appreciably in response to market prices, weather conditions and farm management considerations. The standard FAO method of calculating ETc – using three constant Kc values, each for a fixed length crop stage (Allen et al., 1998) – is, therefore, unsuitable for these crops. To overcome this, a model was developed that estimates Kc values as a function of thermal time inside the greenhouse (Fernández et al., 2001, 2009; Orgaz et al., 2005). The model, which considers greenhouse-grown vegetable crops with and without pruning, is described by Orgaz et al. (2005) and by Fernández et al. (2001, 2009). Two approaches based on thermal time data have been developed to estimate Kc values during the crop development stage. For crops that are only slightly or not pruned, leaf area index (LAI) is estimated from thermal time, and Kc values are then determined from a linear relationship between Kc and LAI. For frequently pruned crops, an empirical linear relationship between Kc and thermal time has been determined for each species; calibration may be necessary in other environments. Tools for calculating crop evapotranspiration of Mediterranean greenhouse crops In Almería, the product of daily ETo, estimated by the Almería radiation method (Fernández et al., 2001, 2010; Bonachela et al., 2006), and daily Kc values, estimated by the model described by Orgaz et al. (2005), is used to provide daily ETc values for major vegetable crop species. Historical climatic data (Bonachela et al., 2006) are used for the calculation of ETo and Kc. As discussed above, ETc in greenhouses may be considered equivalent to crop water requirements. The software PrHo v2.0 was developed by the Las Palmerillas Research Station of the Cajamar Caja Rural to perform these calculations under Almería conditions for major vegetable crops. A detailed description of the ETo-Kc methodology developed by the Las Palmerillas Research Station of the Cajamar Caja Rural to calculate crop water requirements for greenhouse-grown vegetable crops in Almería is given by Fernández et al. (2001, in Spanish), and is available at Fundación Cajamar (2012). The recently developed VegSyst simulation model simulates ETc, crop growth and N uptake of greenhouse-grown vegetable crops (Gallardo et al., 2011; Giménez et al., in press). This model is currently being adapted as a decision support system for combined irrigation and N management in Mediterranean greenhouses (M. Gallardo, personal communication).

The principal advantage of the VegSyst model is that input data are readily available climatic data: maximum and minimum daily air temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity, daily integral of solar radiation, latitude. Historical or real time climatic data can be used. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 118 WATER USE AND IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT General characteristics of irrigation systems used Irrigation management of greenhouse crops in Mediterranean areas is conditioned by the cropping media. In greenhouses in SE Spain, 80 percent of cropping is in soil and 20 percent in free-draining or “open” substrate systems, using mostly perlite and rockwool (Céspedes et al., 2009). Irrigation of soil-grown greenhouse crops in this region is characterized by drip irrigation with above-ground tape; fertigation and irrigation frequencies range from daily in warm conditions to every 3–4 days in winter. Growers’ irrigation management practices A survey of growers’ practices reported that irrigation management (irrigation volumes and frequency) of soil-grown greenhouse crops in Almería was mostly based on the collective experience of growers and technical advisors (Thompson et al., 2007a). In Almería, irrigation based on collective experience consists of fixed schedules that are adapted in response to climatic conditions and crop performance (Thompson et al., 2007a). Irrigation volumes applied by growers to greenhouse crops A survey of total irrigation volumes (crop irrigation supply) applied to vegetable crops grown in commercial Mediterranean greenhouses in Almería was conducted by Fernández et al. (2007). In this study, the average irrigation supply for each of the main greenhouse crops grown in soil, with the exception of tomato, was measured during 6 years in 41 greenhouses. Applied irrigation volumes per crop ranged from 158 mm (autumn green beans) to 363 mm (autumn to spring sweet pepper), and the average value was 228 mm (Fernández et al., 2007). In another crop survey in Almería, an average value of 557 mm was reported for tomato grown with an autumn to spring growing cycle (Carreño et al., 2000). Reported values of total irrigation volumes applied to crops in SE Spain are presented in Table 5. In general, the surveys of commercial irrigation practices in Almería showed that crop irrigation supply increased with the length of the crop cycle, being lower for short cycle crops (e.g. 3–4 month crops of green beans, melon, cucumber and watermelon) and higher for autumn to winter and autumn to spring grown crops (5–9 months). The reported total volumes of irrigation applied per crop (Table 5) were considerably lower than for the same species grown in open field (Fernández et al., 2007). This reflects the relatively lower evaporative demand inside the greenhouse and the fact that crops are often grown during periods (mid- autumn to early spring) of low evaporative demand, as mentioned previously. Values of annual irrigation supply are higher than the crop irrigation supply since many greenhouse growers produce two crops per year. Fernández et al. (2007) reported maximum annual irrigation supply values of 502 mm for a sequence of autumn to winter pepper and spring melon crops. Considering 6. Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 119 greenhouses with single or double crops within a year, the average annual water supply in Almería was 444 mm for soil-grown crops (Fernández et al., 2007). The ratio of crop irrigation supply (total volume applied to a crop) to crop water requirements is known as relative irrigation supply (RIS) and is an indicator of the adequacy of irrigation practices (Fernández et al., 2007). RIS values were determined for the main vegetable species in Almería by dividing crop irrigation supply values, determined in the survey, by crop water requirements calculated with the program PrHo which used the FAO approach adapted to local conditions (Fernández et al., 2008, 2009).

There was very large variability in RIS values between crop species and within cropping cycles for individual crops. For example, RIS values for a complete crop were 1.6 in cucumber and 1.0 in melon (Fernández et al., 2007). In general, RIS values for individual crops were 2–5 during crop establishment and then progressively declined (Fernández et al., 2007). The high RIS values during crop establishment reflect the practice of applying abundant irrigation to ensure the survival and establishment of transplanted plantlets or seedlings, which initially have very small root systems. Thompson et al. (2007a) also compared measured crop irrigation volumes with the crop water requirements calculated by PrHo; in general, the results were similar to those reported by Fernández et al., (2007).

Additional irrigation applications In Almería, in addition to crop irrigation, appreciable volumes of water are routinely applied to soil at other times (Thompson et al., 2007a): • between crops during summer – to disinfect soil • pre-transplant – so that soil is moist when receiving transplanted seedlings Soil disinfection is generally conducted every 1–2 years by applying chemical products in water, by solarization after wetting the soil profile, or by combined solarization and chemical disinfection (Céspedes et al., 2009). Pre-transplant irrigations are applied prior to all transplanted crops. There are few available data of volumes of irrigation applied for soil disinfection and pre-transplant irrigations. Interviews with local technical advisers have suggested representative values of 50 and 20 mm for soil disinfection and pre-transplant irrigations, respectively (Peña, 2009; R. Thompson, University of Almería, personal communication). Total water use associated with greenhouse cropping A regional study (Peña, 2009) was conducted to calculate water use for the Campo de Dalías region in Almería, where 80 percent of the greenhouses in Almería are located. This study considered the following: • water use by soil-grown crops, estimated by multiplying ETc, calculated using the program PrHo (Fernández et al., 2008, 2009), by RIS values (Fernández et al., 2007); • water use of substrate-grown crops, estimated by multiplying ETc, calculated using the program PrHo, by 1.28, 0.28 being the average drainage fraction (they are free-draining substrate systems); and • irrigation applied in soil disinfection and pre-transplant irrigation. Considering all irrigation applied to crops and supplementary irrigations, the average total water use per year was 495 mm (Peña, 2009). This value does not take into account water lost from distribution systems (which can be substantial) or evaporation losses from uncovered on-farm reservoirs.

Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 121 Irrigation scheduling with climatic data For greenhouse-grown crops, the calculation of net crop water requirement considers neither rainfall nor soil water – the latter because the soil is constantly maintained at close to field capacity. Consequently, the applied volume of a single irrigation is equivalent to the cumulative ETc for the period between irrigations plus additional irrigation (if necessary) to consider salinity and irrigation uniformity. Procedures for determining ETc of greenhouse-grown crops were described above. For greenhouse-grown vegetable crops receiving high frequency irrigation, irrigation frequency is usually every day under warm conditions, and every 3–4 days under cooler conditions. Soil water sensors, in particular tensiometers, are an effective method for determining frequency. The Las Palmerillas Research Station of the Cajamar Caja Rural in Almería has developed practical extension tools for assisting farmers and advisors with irrigation scheduling of greenhouse vegetable crops grown in soil. These methods are based on determining crop water requirements, calculated as daily ETc, using the Kc-ETo methodology (described previously), and tensiometers are recommended to determine frequency. These tools, prepared in Spanish, comprise: • published look-up tables; and • computer software PrHo v2.0. The look-up tables refer to the major vegetable species and the most common cropping periods. They are printed as a booklet distributed to growers, and can be downloaded at Fundación Cajamar (2012). They provide values of daily net crop water requirements which are values of daily historical crop evapotranspiration (ETc-h), calculated using historical climatic data which are long-term average values for each day. The software PrHo v2.0 calculates daily crop water requirements for the main greenhouse vegetable crops, for cropping cycles specified by the user, using either daily historical crop evapotranspiration (ETc-h) or real time crop evapotranspiration (as ETc-real) calculated using real time measured climatic data (Fernández et al., 2008, 2009). The PrHo v2.0 software is currently only available in Spanish; it and a user guide (Fernández et al., 2008, also in Spanish) can be downloaded at Fundación Cajamar (2012). ETc-h for a given day of the year is calculated from the average daily values of: • external solar radiation measured for that day over a 17-year period (1983– 2007); and • maximum and minimum air temperatures measured inside the greenhouse, for that day during the period 1988–2007. ETc-real is calculated from: • actual daily values of solar radiation measured outside the greenhouse; and • maximum and minimum daily air temperature measured inside the greenhouse for that particular day. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 122 Within greenhouses in the relatively stable Mediterranean climate of Almería, historical ETc (ETc-h) calculated using long-term average climatic data has been demonstrated to be generally very similar to real time ETc calculated using daily measured climatic data (ETc-real) (Bonachela et al., 2006). The use of historical climatic data offers considerable practical advantages over the use of real time measured climatic data. With ProHo v2.0, the relevant historical data climate values are contained within the program, whereas the real time data have to be entered each day. For the calculation of net crop water requirements (as ETc), the PrHo v2.0 software considers the effect of whitewashing used for cooling. Following the calculation of net crop water requirements (as ETc), the PrHo v2.0 software then calculates gross crop water requirements by considering the salinity of irrigation water and the uniformity coefficient of the irrigation system. The look-up tables provided by the Las Palmerillas Research Station of the Cajamar Caja Rural in Almería and the PrHo v2.0 software are effective and user-friendly tools for preparing irrigation plans for individual crops; the software is able to prepare a more tailor-made plan. In practice, such plans can be supplemented with the use of soil water sensors, such as tensiometers, to assist in determining irrigation frequencies and to adjust volumes. This combined approach (an irrigation plan based on estimated ETc together with sensors) is an effective way to ensure optimal irrigation of greenhouse-grown crops.

This combined approach (an irrigation plan based on estimated ETc together with sensors) is an effective way to ensure optimal irrigation of greenhouse-grown crops. Irrigation scheduling with sensors The use of sensors to monitor soil or plant water status offers the potential to irrigate in accordance with the characteristics of individual greenhouses and cropping conditions (e.g. variations in greenhouse characteristics, crop management and cycles, and soil characteristics). Additionally, these sensors offer the potential for a fine degree of crop management, such as applying controlled stresses for product quality considerations, and control of drainage for salinity or environmental management. Soil water and plant water status sensors can be used on their own as “stand-alone” methods; the two approaches can be combined; they can be used with the FAO method for estimating crop water requirements (Allen et al., 1998); and they can be used as a supplement to irrigation management based on experience. Until the late 1980s, there were few sensors available for measuring soil and plant water status; most required manual measurement, and their use in commercial farms was very limited. Recent technological developments have enabled the development of a new generation of sensors employing recent advances in electronics and information technology. Information on soil and plant water status can now be sent directly to a personal computer, mobile phone or used to automatically activate irrigation controllers. In Mediterranean greenhouses, intensive crop management and small greenhouse size are factors that favour the use of such monitoring technologies. 6. Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 123 Irrigation scheduling with soil water sensors Soil water sensors measure: • volumetric water content of soil (Θv) • soil matric potential (Ψm) The Θv is the ratio of soil volume occupied by water. The Ψm measures the force of retention of soil water by the soil matrix (particles), and indicates the availability of soil water for crops. Whereas interpretation of Ψm data for irrigation management is straightforward, interpretation of Θv for practical irrigation management requires protocols or site-specific experience (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). Soil water sensors can be read manually or with continuous automatic data collection; continuous recording allows more detailed information of the dynamics of water use by the crop and its movement in soil. Soil water sensors can be used with different configurations depending on crop type, irrigation system, cost and mounting of sensors on probes (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). One sensor should be placed in the zone of maximum root concentration; additional sensors can be placed at different depths (e.g. below the roots to control drainage, to the side of the plants to control the size of wetting bulbs from drip irrigation). The most commonly used sensor configurations are: • one sensor within the zone of major root concentration • one sensor within the zone of major root concentration complemented by one or more deeper sensors Irrigation management with soil water sensors is based on maintaining soil water between two limits (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003): • lower limit (drier value) – indication of when to start watering • upper limit (wetter value) – indication of when to stop watering The difference between the two limits is an indication of the volume of irrigation required. The lower limit most commonly chosen permits depletion of soil water without stressing the plant; it can also be used to impose controlled deficit irrigation. The upper limit is normally chosen to prevent excessive drainage from the root zone. It can also be reduced when controlled deficit irrigation is required. The simplest way to determine the volumes to be applied using soil water sensors is to use the selected lower and upper limits to evaluate irrigation (based either on experience or on the use of the FAO method) and then to adjust the applied volumes so that irrigation is maintained within the two limits. Thompson and Gallardo (2003) presented a comprehensive review on the use of soil water sensors for irrigation scheduling in greenhouses. Soil water sensors can be used either manually or automatically to assist with irrigation management. Manual use involves manual programming of irrigation (volume, frequency) following revision of soil water data.

Automatic use involves GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 124 either automatic initiation of irrigation for a fixed period, or both automatic initiation and cessation of irrigation. Automatic control of irrigation requires automatic data recording with short measurement intervals and sensors with rapid responses to changes in soil water status, and a suitable interface with an irrigation controller. Soil water sensors are a dynamic and constantly changing area of technology for technical and commercial reasons. Information on available sensors and their use for irrigation scheduling is provided by Thompson and Gallardo (2003) and Charlesworth (2005). Soil matric potential sensors In non-saline conditions, soil matric potential (Ψm) is a good approximation of the total soil water potential (Ψs). In saline conditions, osmotic potential may contribute significantly to Ψs. The Ψm generally provides a useful measure of the availability of soil water to plants. When using Ψm, the contribution of salinity to Ψs should be considered separately. Some authors (e.g. Hansen et al., 2000) and equipment manufacturers have indicated the upper and lower limits between which the Ψm should be maintained in the root zone for horticultural production in soil. These limits depend on crop species, crop developmental stage, soil texture, and the evaporative conditions. Generally, higher (i.e. less negative) values are used for limits in lighter textured soils. As a general guideline for greenhouse-grown vegetable crops with high frequency irrigation, Ψm intervals of -10–-20 kPa, -10–-30 kPa and -20–-40 kPa for coarse, medium and fine textured soils respectively have been suggested (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). Lower limits of -35–-58 kPa were suggested by Thompson et al. (2007b) for different species of greenhouse-grown vegetable crops in a sandy-loam soil, based on initial detection of plant water stress. The two types of matric potential sensors most suitable for protected horticultural crops are tensiometers and granular matrix sensors. Tensiometers are cheap, simple and easy to use. They require preparation and proper maintenance to provide accurate and reliable data (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). There are three types: • manual tensiometers – data are obtained from the visual reading of a vacuum gauge • manual tensiometers – a switch directly activates the irrigation equipment when it reaches a predetermined value • electric tensiometers – pressure transducers provide continuous measurement and can be used to directly activate irrigation Most tensiometers usually have a working range of 0–-80 kPa. This narrow range is often a limitation in open-field cropping systems. However, for greenhouse vegetable crops with high frequency irrigation, Ψm generally remains within these limits. Exceptions occur when the evaporative demand and leaf area are high (e.g. 6. Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 125 with mature melon crops in May–June in SE Spain). Models of tensiometers are available from major manufacturers (Irrometer Co., CA, USA; Soilmoisture Equipment Co., CA, USA) that have a reduced operating range (e.g. 0–-40 kPa); these models have a more rapid response and are suitable for coarse soils and some substrates where most plant available water is retained with less tension than in soil. Granular matrix (GM) sensors measure the electrical resistance between two electrodes in a porous matrix (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003; Charlesworth, 2005). The most commonly used is the Watermark sensor (Irrometer Co., CA, USA). The electrical resistance between the two electrodes is a function of the soil matric potential. The water within the sensor matrix equilibrates with that of the soil. A hand-held reader is used to supply the current and read the values. Data can be recorded on data loggers or input to an irrigation controller. An internal factory calibration, in the hand-held reader, is used to relate measurement of electrical resistance to soil matric potential. For research applications, the user can provide other calibration equations (Thompson et al., 2006). GM sensors are cheap, simple, easy to install and have few preparation and maintenance requirements. The measuring range is -10–-200 kPa.

While they have a wider measurement range than tensiometers, they tend to be less reliable in wet soils (0–-10 kPa) and have a slower response in soils that dry very quickly (Thompson et al., 2006). In general, GM sensors are somewhat less accurate than tensiometers but require appreciably less attention. They have a life span of 5–7 years. Soil volumetric water content sensors Various groups of sensors measure the volumetric soil water content (Θv): neutron moisture-probe, di-electric sensors, and heat dissipation sensors. The di-electric sensors are those mostly used for irrigation scheduling (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). There are three general types of di-electric sensor: • TDR (time domain refractometer) • TDT (time domain transmissometer) • capacitance, or FDR (frequency domain refractometer) Plate 5 Manual tensiometer installed in soil in a greenhouse GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 126 TDR sensors with stainless steel probes > 10 cm long are widely used in research; however, they are not widely used for irrigation management. TDT sensors are an adaptation of TDR sensors that are generally cheaper and electronically simpler, and consequently more suitable for use in commercial farming. Capacitance (or FDR) sensors are widely used in both research applications and to manage irrigation in commercial farms. Capacitance sensors are available in several different configurations, for example, probes of various lengths or rings at various depths (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). The capacitance sensor most used for irrigation management is the EnviroSCAN (Sentek Technologies, Australia) consisting of several ring-type sensors mounted vertically at various depths on a probe which is enclosed in a PVC tube within the soil. This equipment continuously registers soil humidity giving detailed information on the dynamics of soil water both within the root zone and below. These sensors can be used to automatically initiate and stop irrigation. The EnviroSCAN can be sensitive to changes in soil salinity (Thompson et al., 2007c) which can affect its use where salinity is managed to increase fruit quality. Various models and configurations of the EnviroSCAN are available (Charlesworth, 2005). When using Θv for IS, the determination of lower irrigation limits (i.e. when to irrigate) is not as straightforward as when using Ψm (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). When using Ψm, standard commonly available values are used (e.g. Hansen et al., 2000). With Θv, values have to be determined for each combination of crops and soil. Different protocols to determine lower limits for greenhouse vegetable crops in soil were evaluated by Thompson et al. (2007d). Some models of di-electric sensor also measure soil electrical conductivity (EC); this is measured in the form of bulk soil EC which is the conductivity per unit volume of soil. Bulk soil EC is strongly influenced by soil water content and is more difficult to interpret than more commonly used measures of soil salinity such as saturated extract EC or soil solution (or pore water) EC. Some sensor Plate 6 EnviroSCAN capacitance sensors for measuring volumetric soil water content: installation of an EnviroSCAN probe with four capacitance sensors at different depths (left) and an EnviroSCAN probe after installation (right) 6. Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 127 systems use internal equations to calculate pore water EC values from bulk soil EC and Θv measurements. Irrigation scheduling with plant sensors Three kinds of plant sensors can be used for irrigation management (Gallardo and Thompson, 2003): • stem diameter sensors • sap flow sensors • sensors of leaf/crop canopy temperature Stem diameter sensors measure both stem contractions occurring during the day in response to transpiration and stem growth; both parameters are very sensitive to water stress. In recent years there has been considerable research with these sensors in woody crops, and some adoption in commercial farms. In vegetable crops, they are sensitive to water stress; however, in short-cycle crops, the rapid growth rate makes data interpretation more difficult (Gallardo et al., 2006a, 2006b). Furthermore, their sensitivity to detecting water stress in greenhouse-grown vegetable crops decreases during winter conditions", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Furthermore, their sensitivity to detecting water stress in greenhouse-grown vegetable crops decreases during winter conditions of low evaporative demand (Gallardo et al., 2006a, 2006b). Sap flow sensors that directly measure plant transpiration have similarly been mostly investigated in woody crops. Because of their high cost and technical complexity, they have been mostly used in research with limited use for irrigation management of horticultural crops. The temperature difference between the leaf or the crop canopy and the environment is a sensitive indicator of plant water stress. Indicators proposed for irrigation based on this measure include the CWSI (crop water stress index). As yet, there have been few commercial applications of this method. However, research is continuing, particularly in combination with remote sensing technologies. To date, plant sensors have had less practical application for irrigation management than soil water sensors, particularly for vegetable crops. General considerations regarding the use of sensors for irrigation When sensors are used for irrigation management, there are two important practical considerations: • replication, with a minimum of 2–3 sensors per crop • location of the sensors, which should be representative of the crop Other practical considerations include cost, ease of use, preparation and maintenance requirements, technical support, ease of data interpretation, availability of irrigation protocols, working language, and the user friendliness of software where computer use is required (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 128 In general, there is appreciably more use of soil sensors for irrigation management than of plant sensors. Of the soil sensors, probably the most used sensors for irrigation management are tensiometers and capacitance sensors. Two important considerations with capacitance sensors are the cost and sensitivity of some models to changes in salinity. Tensiometers are very suitable for greenhouse vegetable crops in soil because of their low cost, simplicity and reliability; they are not affected by salinity and their narrow working range is not usually a limitation in greenhouse soils that generally remain moist. IRRIGATION SCHEDULING OF GREENHOUSE CROPS GROWN IN SUBSTRATE Large areas of greenhouse crops are grown in substrate in the Mediterranean Basin, including approximately 5 000 ha in SE Spain. Substrate is mostly associated with newer greenhouses of relatively high technological level. These are nearly all free-draining or “open” substrate systems, mostly in perlite or rockwool, with some use of coconut fibre. Due to the small volume occupied by the root system and retention of water by substrates at very low tensions, irrigation management of crops grown in substrate requires a much more precise control than for equivalent crops in soil. Additionally, the mineral substrates (e.g. rockwool, perlite) most commonly used for vegetable crop production have very little nutrient buffering capacity. In order to maintain plant available water and to prevent excessive fluctuations in root zone salinity, small frequent irrigations are applied. To prevent salt accumulation, leaching fractions of 20–40 percent are used; the leaching fraction increases with the salinity of applied nutrient solutions. A revision of irrigation scheduling in substrates in Mediterranean greenhouses is presented by Medrano et al. (2003). The water applied in each irrigation must compensate for the crop water uptake between irrigations. The volume must take into account the water retention capacity of the substrate and the leaching requirements. As a starting point, the volume of irrigation can be calculated as 5–10 percent of available water in the substrate plus the leaching fraction. Irrigation frequency depends on climate and crop development stage. Most irrigation control methods used with substrate determine the frequency of irrigation and use fixed irrigation volumes. The methods of IS in substrate are classified according to the information used to activate irrigation. Methods involve either direct activation, when irrigation is triggered with a sensor, or indirect activation, when a decision is made after processing previously collected climatic data. Sensors for direct activation may be soil water sensors or water level sensors. Where direct activation is used, the leaching fraction is commonly also measured, either manually or automatically, to ensure adequate", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Water requirements and irrigation management in Mediterranean greenhouses 129 The most commonly used method in commercial greenhouses in SE Spain is the use of water level sensors, also known as the demand tray system. These sensors are installed in a small water reservoir (commonly a tray) in which the volume of water (and therefore the surface level) is in equilibrium with the water content of the substrate. When the water level in the reservoir decreases, through crop uptake, to the physical level of the sensor, irrigation is activated. The physical height of the sensor is adjusted by the grower on the basis of measured drainage volumes and experience. This method can be used once the crop root system is established. Of the soil water sensors, some di-electric sensors and tensiometers have been used for crop irrigation management in substrates (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003). The di-electric sensors include the EnviroSCAN, the Theta probe and WET sensor (Delta-T Devices, UK), the Decagon range of soil moisture sensors (Decagon Devices, USA), and the Grodan WCM Continuous Sensor (Grodan, the Netherlands). Tensiometers with a reduced scale (e.g. 0–-40 kPa) and rapid response have been used with artificial substrates and culture media (e.g. sand). The most commonly used substrates in SE Spain – perlite and rockwool – retain water within a narrow range of Ψm values of 0–-10 kPa; to irrigate these substrates using Ψm, specialized tensiometers are required. Plate 7 Irrigation of substrate-grown crops.

The most common method used with substrate is to initiate irrigation on the basis of measurements of the integral of solar radiation above the crop. This method which is commonly used in Dutch greenhouses is discussed by Medrano et al. (2003). In this method, evapotranspiration is estimated from solar radiation using an empirical equation that includes a crop coefficient and a radiation transmission coefficient. In this method, an accumulated radiation threshold value is used to activate irrigation. Transpiration models based on the energy balance have been developed for substrate-grown crops – an example is that of Baille et al. (1994), a simplification of the Penman-Monteith equation. These models are integrated into the irrigation programmer and irrigation is triggered when a specified volume of simulated transpiration has occurred. Practical application is limited by the requirements for climatic and leaf area data, and for data of physiological parameters such as stomatal and aerodynamic resistances. This method was adapted by Medrano et al. (2005) for cucumber in Almería and accurately estimated crop water uptake. The “Monades” software, based on transpiration estimation, was developed by Medrano et al. (2003) for automatic irrigation management of substrate-grown crops. WATER-USE EFFICIENCY (WUE) OF GREENHOUSE CROPS IN MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATES In greenhouse vegetable crops, the irrigation water-use efficiency (kg m-3, WUE), expressed as the ratio between marketable crop production and total crop irrigation supply, is higher than in open field crops due to the low evaporative demand inside the greenhouse that reduces water requirements and the higher productivity of greenhouse-grown crops. The WUE of tomato crops grown under different growing conditions (open field, greenhouse, soil, substrate etc.) is presented in Table 6.

The water productivity (WP, € m-3), defined as the ratio of total value of production to total crop irrigation water supply, varied from 7.8 to 15.9 € m-3 and was highest for green bean crops (Fernández et al., 2007). WP values of greenhouse crops are generally much higher than for open field crops throughout the world, including in Mediterranean areas, due to the low water use and particularly to the high economic value of vegetable crops grown out of season.

(2007) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 132 GAP recommendations Soil-grown crops • For soil-grown crops in Mediterranean greenhouses, crop water requirements can be considered to be equal to ETc because there is usually little depletion of soil moisture during a crop and no rainfall enters the greenhouse. • Daily and seasonal ETc of crops grown in Mediterranean greenhouses can be calculated using the FAO approach as the product of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and crop coefficient (Kc) values. ETo can be calculated from climatic data using suitable adaptations of the Penman-Monteith equation or with relatively simple equations based on solar radiation data. For calculation of ETo for subsequent estimation of ETc, average values of long-term climatic data can be used because of the low interannual climatic variation associated with Mediterranean climatic conditions. Crop coefficients can be calculated using available models based on temperature inside the greenhouse. This enables adaptation to particular planting dates and lengths of growing cycles which vary appreciably depending on markets conditions. The standard values of Kc reported by FAO for outdoor vegetables are not suitable for the tall canopies of supported crops grown in greenhouses. • There are simple tools (in Spanish) that are freely available (e.g. the PrHo software, look-up tables) to calculate ETc for a given crop, greenhouse and season, using historical or real time climatic data. Furthermore, the software calculates daily gross water requirements considering salinity and irrigation uniformity. This material can be supplemented by soil water sensors (e.g. tensiometers) to ensure optimal irrigation of greenhouse-grown crops. • Soil water sensors (alone or as a supplement of the ETc method) are effective tools for optimizing irrigation of soil-grown crops. When using soil water sensors, growers and technical advisers should be aware of the limitations of the particular sensors being used, e.g. operational range, responsiveness and sensitivity to salinity. Manual tensiometers are effective soil water sensors with soil-grown crops grown with frequent drip irrigation. They are relatively cheap and simple to use; however, potential users should be aware that they require preparation and maintenance to be most effective.

This material can be supplemented by soil water sensors (e.g. tensiometers) to ensure optimal irrigation of greenhouse-grown crops. • Soil water sensors (alone or as a supplement of the ETc method) are effective tools for optimizing irrigation of soil-grown crops. When using soil water sensors, growers and technical advisers should be aware of the limitations of the particular sensors being used, e.g. operational range, responsiveness and sensitivity to salinity. Manual tensiometers are effective soil water sensors with soil-grown crops grown with frequent drip irrigation. They are relatively cheap and simple to use; however, potential users should be aware that they require preparation and maintenance to be most effective. Substrate-grown crops • For substrate-grown crops in Mediterranean greenhouses, crop water requirements are equal to crop evapotranspiration (ETc) plus a drainage fraction to prevent salt accumulation. • A system of automatic irrigation scheduling is essential to manage the frequent small irrigations applied to substrate-grown crops. Frequent irrigation with small volumes is required because of the limited root volume and water-holding capacity of substrates. The available systems are methods based on: - sensors that trigger irrigation (e.g. water level sensors, soil water sensors suitable for substrates), - methods based on the estimation of crop water requirements from climatic data (e.g. radiation), or - transpiration models that can be integrated into the irrigation programmer. • The control of root-zone salinity is a fundamental consideration for the irrigation management of substrate-grown crops. 6.

Protected cultivation for improving water-use efficiency of vegetable crops in the NENA region1 Ayman F. Abou Hadid Arid Land Agricultural Studies and Research Institute (ALARI) Faculty of Agriculture, Ain Shams University, Egypt INTRODUCTION In recent years, vegetables grown under protected cultivation in the NENA (Near East and North Africa) region underwent rapid expansion, with crops varying from one country to another. The total area of vegetable production in selected NENA countries exceeds 1.8 million ha (Figure 1) and includes: tomatoes (24%), potatoes (24%), watermelons (15%) and ‘Cantaloupe’ and melon (9%). FIGURE 1 Production percentage share of vegetables in selected NENA countriesa Pumpkin and squash; 9 Eggplant; 4 Green beans; 4 Cucumber and gherkin; 4 ‘Cantaloupe’ and melon; 9 Watermelons; 15 Tomato; 24 Potato; 24 Others; 12 Area of vegetable crops in some countries of NENA region (Ha) Total area in the region = 1 836 000 ha a Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 138 The development of protected cultivation in Egypt is representative of the rapid revolution of this industry in the region as a whole. In 1985 there was a boom in the use of plasticulture in Egypt: the total area covered by mulching, low tunnels and plastic houses was about 1 658 ha in 1986 (360 ha for mulching, 1 000 ha for low tunnels and 298 ha for plastic houses). A year later, a ministerial decree established the National Committee for Protected Cultivation to be responsible for protected cultivation (research, development, training and extension) throughout the country. In 1990–91, the area was 12 363 ha, distributed as follows: 890 ha for mulching, 836 ha for plastic houses and 10 637 ha for low tunnels (Table 1). Vegetable production under low tunnels has increased significantly in Egypt and is used mainly for early production of cucumber, tomatoes, ‘Cantaloupe’, sweet peppers, melons, strawberries and beans for local consumption and exportation. Low tunnels are simple to apply and manage; moreover they are cheaper than plastic houses. Productivity of vegetable crops varies from one country to another, but in all cases tomatoes give the highest productivity (Figure 2). Protected cultivation is an important technology for improving vegetable productivity: it covers a wide time span of the year, and, most importantly, it saves water and boosts yields as a result of improved water-use efficiency (WUE = yield/water consumption).

Improving water-use efficiency of vegetable crops in the NENA region 139 WATER RESOURCES IN THE REGION Water resource management and water availability are among the most important political, social and economic issues of the twenty-first century (Harsh et al., 1989; Krug, 1989; Medany et al., 1997). In Egypt, the misuse of limited water resources causes serious yield reductions in traditional agromanagement systems. Protected cultivation can easily double the water-use efficiency of vegetable crops as crop water requirements are easily managed under protected cultivation systems. Irrigated areas and irrigation techniques Almost 40 percent of food production in the Mediterranean is derived from irrigated farming systems where irrigation accounts for almost 72 percent of all freshwater withdrawals across the region (UNESCO, 2006). In the last two decades, due to the increasing waves of drought in south Mediterranean countries, supplemental irrigation areas have gradually increased to cover more than 50 percent of the rainfed agricultural area. As the proportion of irrigated area in the total cultivated area increases, agricultural productivity becomes more stable and the effects of climate variability under current conditions are felt less. On the other hand, as a result of global change, the water demand of irrigated agriculture rises due to higher evapotranspiration and increased competition between key water sectors. Egypt has the highest proportion of irrigated area among the Mediterranean countries with over 95% of Egyptian cultivated area dependent on irrigation. Albania has the second highest irrigated area percentage (49%), while for other Mediterranean countries the irrigated area accounts for less than 40%.

If the amount of water applied grossly exceeds that actually needed for replenishment, the irrigation efficiency is very low. Irrigation efficiency or water application efficiency is calculated using the formula: where: Ea is application efficiency Et is evapotranspiration (potential Et or Et0) Id is irrigation water delivered at the farmgate Irrigation application efficiency (Ea) is the ratio in % of water delivered at the farmgate to the amount stored in the active root zone. This ratio can vary from extremely low values to values approaching 100 percent (Israelsen and Hansen, 1962). However, in normal irrigation practices, the application efficiency of surface irrigation is about 60%, of well-designed sprinkler irrigation systems 75% and of drip irrigation up to 90%. Water-use efficiency Water resource problems often derive from lack of efficiency in water use in agricultural, industrial and domestic supply. Hamdy and Lacirignola (1999) reported that agriculture is by far the most important water-use activity; it is probably also the sector least efficient in water use. Low irrigation efficiency can be primarily attributed to water mismanagement, in addition to technical problems of conveyance, distribution or on-farm application, as well as poor maintenance of irrigation structures, often resulting from inadequate investment in operation and maintenance. In order to increase irrigation efficiency, it is necessary to improve system water management and on-farm water management; for the latter, the farmer’s role is crucial. Irrigation efficiency was developed to optimize land- and water-use requirements, especially for agronomic purposes. Tanner and Sinclair (1983) presented a detailed and comprehensive review of the different methods and models of calculating water-use efficiency. The phrases “efficient water use” or “water-use efficiency” are intrinsically ambiguous in relation to crop production: they could mean saving water from a given supply for crop use, or increasing production per hectare per unit of water evaporated from the soil or transpired from the plants in the field. The term water-use efficiency has been employed very loosely by plant scientists and agronomists to refer to a range", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Improving water-use efficiency of vegetable crops in the NENA region 141 by individual leaves for just a few minutes to grain yield response to irrigation treatments over an entire season (Sinclair, 1984). For agronomists, water-use efficiency (WUE), measured in kg/m3, is commonly defined as: The quantity of water used to produce yield may be expressed in different ways. The simplified way of calculating water-use efficiency is: where: E is evaporation N/T is transpiration efficiency2 N is dry matter production T is transpiration (Gregory, 1991) Tanner and Sinclair (1993) analysed crop water-use efficiency results and reached the conclusion that further substantial improvements could be achieved through plant breeding as well as appropriate agronomic practices. However, in a broader geographical sense, substantial improvements in water-use efficiency can be made by matching crop production with areas of low vapour pressure deficit. In general, solar radiation, saturation deficits and evapotranspirational demand in a region increase as precipitation and cloudiness decrease. Climatic divisions for regional aridity in the contiguous United States were reported in areas where saturation deficits and evapotranspiration increase. Although potential productivity under irrigation can increase with aridity because of increased sunshine and extended growing period, advection adds to the evapotranspiration of irrigated fields with no concomitant increase in productivity. Irrigation in humid areas Since irrigation often produces yield increases in humid regions (where precipitation exceeds 750 mm per day), Tanner and Sinclair (1983) conclude that overall crop water-use efficiency in the United States can be best improved by placing greater emphasis on water management and irrigation technology in humid areas. In addition, increased yields could be achieved in humid regions with a much lower water input than in more arid areas: rainfall provides much of the required water, and transpiration losses are lower. An increasingly important consideration is that in humid regions – where there is a much greater water availability, usually of high quality – salinization is not a problem. Further considerations are detailed below.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 142 • Irrigation research has been neglected in humid regions, where unpredictable rainfall poses different technical problems to those in dry regions where most irrigation technology has been developed. • The soil fertilizing practices adopted in humid regions have been developed with little regard for the interaction between water-use efficiency and irrigation efficiency; research is required to develop sound fertilizer and irrigation practices that recognize this interaction and minimize leaching while maintaining an adequate soil water supply for the crop – increasingly important with shallow-rooted crops and sandy soils. Irrigation practices that do not bring the root zone to full water supply are essential for reducing energy use in irrigation and avoiding nitrate contamination of the groundwater (Tanner and Sinclair, 1983). • Erosion hazards are greater in humid regions where unpredicted precipitation can follow irrigation; on sloping land, irrigation practices must be integrated with sound conservation measures. • Plant disease, insects and weeds not found in dry regions can be a problem under irrigation in humid regions. • Trafficability for field operations is often a problem on fine-textured soils under natural rainfall, and the problem worsens when crops are irrigated. • Increasing energy costs affect the feasibility of irrigation in both arid and humid regions; further assessment is required in humid regions where the availability of the water supply and probability of yield increases are important factors. Indeed, the use of electric power for pumping is seasonal, and there are weather-induced uncertainties about timing irrigation; therefore management of power generation and distribution for load peaks is an increasing problem.

Indeed, the use of electric power for pumping is seasonal, and there are weather-induced uncertainties about timing irrigation; therefore management of power generation and distribution for load peaks is an increasing problem. In short, scheduling irrigation must help optimize fertilizer use, soil conservation, pest control, power requirement, electric load management, and other crop management practices for high productivity and minimal environmental damage (groundwater pollution, soil loss) in the presence of unpredictable rainfall. Improved medium-scale forecasting of rainfall would help improve water-use efficiency, but given the forecasting advances already made since 1900, there is little room left for further improvement. Factors affecting water-use efficiency • Water delivery systems. Open canals, lined ditches and pipelines vary in their ability to convey water and in the losses made. At macro level, the water conveyance system is a major factor in determining water-use efficiency. • Irrigation systems and water delivery systems. There are various methods for increasing water availability for transpiration. Factors to be considered for maximizing the availability of water are improvement of water movement in the soils, absorption by the roots and movement through the plant. 7. Improving water-use efficiency of vegetable crops in the NENA region 143 • Crop shape and morphology. When soil evaporation is low, crops with closed-leaf canopies (depending mainly on genetic factors) have better water- use efficiency. • Climatic factors. The climate affects the physical processes controlling crop evapotranspiration and is key to the management and minimization of water loss. Water deficits developing in crops severely limit the ability of crops to produce an economic yield. • Management. Appropriate decisions aim to increase the amount of water available for crop production and to improve crop growth characteristics in order to increase economic yield. • Economic considerations. The cash return per unit of yield is central to improving efficiency. • Techniques for predicting yield. The economic component of the crop must be considered. Crop productivity per unit area of land and water consumption per unit of yield must be taken into account. Maximum cash return per unit volume of water in a given area is important in crop selection. • Social and political factors. They condition whether or not to give priority to increasing water-use efficiency in crop production in a given area. Efficient water management systems Information related to on-farm water use is available in a wide range of publications. This section explores the methods and approaches to improving water-use efficiency in agriculture. Water-use efficiency varies depending on the irrigation system. It was reported by Doneen and Westcot (1988) that the amount of water required for irrigation can be estimated by sampling the soil at several places in the field and estimating the moisture deficit. The water application is then calculated allowing for the possible losses. Irrigation efficiency for sprinkler irrigation is 60–70%, localized irrigation approximately 80%, basin irrigation 45–75%, and furrow irrigation 40–65%. Irrigation timing during the hot dry season can be estimated on the basis of the consumptive use. If the maximum consumptive use rates are known for the crop and area, divide the available moisture held in the rooting depth of the soil (mm) by the consumptive use rate (mm/day) to estimate the number of days between irrigations. This procedure should not be used for early season irrigations; neither does it apply to young plants with incomplete root development, or to special applications, such as preplanting or leaching irrigations. For all irrigation methods, it may be assumed that a uniform soil will absorb about the same amount of water in one location in a field as in another, if the water is in contact with the soil for the same length of time, i.e., if intake “opportunity time” is the same at all points in the field, uniform application of water can be expected throughout the field. While most irrigation methods do not permit water to be applied for exactly the same length of time in each place, they can share this goal.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 144 Improving irrigation efficiency – GAP recommendations Before irrigating, check the soil moisture in the root zone at several locations. Estimate the amount of water needed to bring the soil to field capacity. About 2–3 days after irrigation, check the soil moisture again. The moisture should be close to field capacity throughout the rooting depth. There should be no dry spots or dry layers in the field. Determine the depth of water in centimetres applied to the field during irrigation. This will require the measurement of the stream size and the period of time the water was delivered to the field. Then calculate the depth applied. For sprinklers, multiply the application rate in millimetres by the number of hours that the sprinklers operate at one setting. How does the estimation of the amount of water needed compare with the amount delivered to the field? Approximately what irrigation efficiency was obtained? High efficiency can be secured. However, if only a small amount of water is put on dry soil, irrigation may be poor. During an irrigation, check whether the intake opportunity time is about the same throughout the field. When irrigating using the border method, does the water stand about as long at the lower end and middle of the field as it does at the upper end? If furrows are used, does the water reach the lower end in about one-fourth of the total time that it is at the upper end? Are basins and level borders filled quickly? Observe the amount of irrigation water running off the surface of the field as waste. A large amount of surface runoff from a border indicates that the stream is too large or that water has been run into the border strip for too long. When the water in a well-designed border (not a level border) approaches the lower end of the strip, the stream may be reduced or cut off at the upper end. In this way, even distribution is obtained with little or no runoff. The stream size must be properly adjusted to the soil intake rate and to the border length if the border is to be evenly irrigated without excessive runoff. If furrow runoff is excessive, the furrow stream should be reduced to about one- or two-thirds of the initial flow after the water reaches the lower end. Watch for evidence of too much water being used as it may be as costly as using too little. Losses may occur in four different ways from overirrigation: • high cost of excess water use • leaching of plant food below the root zone of the crop plants • waterlogging of some or all of the farmland • reduced yield (of some crops) Irrigation water should be used efficiently to achieve an even spread over the field and fill the soil reservoir. However, in the final analysis, it is the amount of crop produced with the water supply available that determines the real efficiency of the water use. Crops can be efficiently irrigated once or twice during the season and still fail to yield well because of lack of moisture during part of the growing season. Furthermore, water can only be used efficiently if good farming methods and good irrigation practices are followed. The water supply rate applied through different irrigation systems should never exceed the rate of infiltration of the water in the soil, to avoid water runoff 7. Improving water-use efficiency of vegetable crops in the NENA region 145 PROTECTED CULTIVATIONS The use of greenhouse and plastic house techniques has contributed significantly to the improvement of water-use efficiency. The plastic or glass cover creates a special microclimate (Abou Hadid and El-Beltagy, 1991) in which radiation and wind movement are lower but relative air humidity is higher than in the open field, favouring a reduction in evapotranspiration (Eissa et al., 1991).

Increase in yield and reduction in water consumption under protected cultivation was reported by Abou Hadid et al. (1992). Protected cultivation produces higher yields with less water: water-use efficiency is improved (Abou Hadid and El Beltagy, 1992). The efficient use of water in greenhouses is also reflected in the efficient use of fertilizers (Medany et al., 1997). Many reports on this subject (Ismail et al., 1996; El-Behairy et al., 1996; Abd Elmoniem et al., 1996) indicate that in plastic houses protected cultivation and soilless culture techniques improve the nutritional conditions and nutritional problems not easily solved under open field conditions. SOILLESS CULTURE 3 A remarkable example of the efficient use of water resources is the use of substrates in soilless culture for better vegetable quality and as a means for improving water- use efficiency. To clarify the relationship between substrate culture and water-use efficiency, it should be noted that: field-grown tomato produces 3 kg/m3 of water; plastic house soil-grown tomato produces 17 kg/m3; tomato grown in substrate under plastic house conditions in Egypt was reported to produce 45 kg/m3. Soilless culture techniques were developed under glasshouses in order to overcome major agricultural problems, including nutrition, plant diseases and environmental pollution. It was later discovered to be an efficient water-saving tool. The development of a simple low-cost hydroponic system was the main challenge to enable soilless culture. Several attempts to design and implement soilless culture techniques were made and proved to be economically viable and environmentally safe. Water-use efficiency was thus greatly improved and the chemicals used for nutrition and pest and disease control reduced to a very low level. Production costs are relatively high but future research looks to reducing costs and improving applicability on a large scale in arid lands. Limited water resources and high population growth were the main factors leading to the use of intensive agriculture in Egypt. Protected cultivation was the first step, starting in the late 1970s and intensifying in the mid-1980s. Maximizing 3 Information on soilless culture is elaborated in chapter 12 and advantages of microirrigation systems are described in chapter 8. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 146 crop yield per square metre of soil and cubic metre of water could be achieved through the use of hydroponic systems (Zayed et al. 1989). A range of soilless culture options are available for use in Egypt. Nutrient film technique (NFT) and rockwool are the most widespread systems, despite the fact that rockwool needs replacing every other year, entailing an additional cost compared with NFT. Efforts to introduce NFT in Egypt began in tourist villages where the soil could not be cultivated successfully. Water-use efficiency may also be improved by adopting other systems, such as aeroponic systems (El Shinawy et al., 1996).

Microirrigation Giancarlo Barbieri and Albino Maggio Department of Agricultural Engineering and Agronomy University of Naples Federico II, Italy METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MICROIRRIGATION This section provides an overview of microirrigation systems used for greenhouse crops. It presents a description of the main components, the basic knowledge required for proper management and practical guidelines to deal with most common issues that farmers may need to address. The term “microirrigation” refers to those systems operating at low flow rates and low pressures (< 1.5–2 bar) and providing localized distribution of the water, normally in proximity of the plant or the root systems. The main components of microirrigation systems are: • pump • system of filters • control valves • delivery system: - mainlines, made of PVC or polyethylene (PE), to convey water from source to the submains - submains (PVC or PE) to supply water to the drip lines - drip lines, made mostly of LDPE (low density polyethylene), placed along the rows of the crop on which emitters are connected - emission devices through which water is delivered at the root zone of the plant via dripping, bubbling and microsprinkling (these can be of various types, suited to serve one or more plants)", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

That is why it is essential to always include a filtering apparatus upstream of the distribution line. Depending on the type of installation, the emitters are divided into two types: • On-line drippers placed on the polyethylene line transporting water along the rows of the crop. They can be easily inserted on polyethylene pipes of different diameters allowing a good operational flexibility (number and spacing of the emitters can be adjusted to fit plant spacing for most row crops). Drip lines can be either suspended or laid on the soil surface. • In-line drippers mounted along the pipe. They are an integral part of the polyethylene pipe. This type of dripper is more resistant to emitter occlusions; it is suitable for placing on the ground along the row of the crop or under the mulch. Microirrigation systems can be grouped in six main categories: • Systems with drip lines (operating pressure: 0.5–2.0 bar; flow rates 0.5–4 litres/ hour. • Systems with drippers (operating pressures: 1–4 bar; flow rates 2–20 litres/ hour). • Systems with emitters (operating pressures: 1–3 bar; flow rates 6–30 litres/ hour). • Systems with capillary tubes (operating pressures: 1–2.5 bar; flow rates 0.7–7 litres/hour). • Systems with micro-/minisprinklers. • Subsurface drip irrigation. Systems with drip lines This category includes the common perforated hoses, consisting of a thin tube of polyethylene (generally 0.15–0.20 mm) with holes at a fixed distance. The perforated tubes do not have a flow rate control system and, therefore, they do not guarantee uniformity of distribution, which tends to be quite uneven due to frequent clogging of the holes. The true drip lines (where the waterflow is controlled) are divided into light drip lines and lines with dripper. Light drip lines, often used for annual crops planted in rows, are equipped with emitters that permit uniform water distribution thanks to a built-in labyrinth system that reduces both the pressure 8. Microirrigation 151 and the speed of the water. Drip lines with dripper, thanks to a greater thickness of the tube, last longer, provide more uniform irrigation and are suitable for long-term crops. There are also systems of drip lines with self-compensating drippers, which are used for sloping ground or for very long distances. In these cases, there will be marked differences between the pressure at the beginning and at the end of the drip line, affecting the flow rate of individual drippers. The self- compensating drippers maintain constant flow rates at different pressures and can efficiently work under these conditions. The self-compensating feature is given by a membrane of highly elastic plastic material that, solicited by water pressure, is deformed. The consequent expansion or reduction of the emitter’s output section stabilizes the waterflow. Many self-compensating drippers also have a self- washing mechanism (anti-clogging) of the labyrinth. The working principle of the self-washing mechanism is that up to about 0.5–0.7 bar, the membrane does not deform causing a turbulent flow in the tube (greater than the nominal flow rate) capable of removing particles that may accumulate inside the dripper. Systems with drippers These systems consist of low density polyethylene tubes (diameter 16–25 mm) on which drippers are inserted at a proper distance based on the crop requirements.

Button-type or arrow-type drippers may be used. Button-type drippers comprise a special labyrinth (described above), allowing a certain uniformity of the flow. Also in this case, the self-compensating models provide a constant flow regardless of changes in the working pressure (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Variation of the flow rate of different types of drippers with the operating pressure Capillary tube Labyrinth Self-compensating with closure Flow rate (litres/hour) Pressure (bar) Incrocci and Riccò, 2004 (adapted) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 152 These drippers can be mounted either directly on the line (delivering water to the plants via a thin tube of polyethylene) or at the end of short strands inserted on the main lines. Furthermore, there are special derivations that allow single emitters connected directly on the tube of polyethylene to have multiple outputs (up to eight), thus reducing the overall irrigation system costs. A particular type of dripper is the anti- drain CNL (compensated no leakage). In this case, the dripper is equipped with a special membrane which completely closes the leakage of water when the pressure drops below a predetermined value (0.3–1 bar, depending on the model), preventing the emptying of the line. This may be an advantage for soilless crops, which typically require short and numerous irrigations. In this case, there is the risk of excessive supply of water in the final parts of the line for the emptying of the line itself. The arrow-type drippers are also labyrinth type but are connected to the main line via tiny tubes of polyethylene. These can be easily inspected for malfunctioning and cleaned by inverting the tiny tubes that connect the drippers to the main polyethylene lines. Systems with intermittent emitters These systems are characterized by high unitary flow rates (6–30 litres/hour, with operating pressures of 1–3 bar). The main advantages of these systems are the reduced incidence of clogging, as a consequence of the higher operating flow rate, and the greater wet surface compared with systems with classic drippers. These features overall allow more uniform growth of the root systems. Systems with capillary tubes These systems are becoming widespread due to their low cost and the possibility of having the lines already pre-assembled by the manufacturer, with considerable labour saving. This system consists of a polyethylene tube of 20–25 mm diameter, on which are inserted capillaries of 0.5–1.5 mm internal diameter with adequate length to reach the point of dispensing. In these cases, for a given pressure, the flow rate is directly proportional to the diameter of the capillary and inversely proportional to its length. Figure 2 shows the typical ranges in function of these two parameters. Plate 1 Tomato irrigated with arrow drippers inserted into the peat growing bags 8. Microirrigation 153 The system is equipped with rods to be connected at the end of the capillary to allow proper positioning close to the plant roots. Although this type of system is economical, it does not provide uniform water distribution because of pressure losses along the line. Therefore lines with many drip points should be avoided. With this type, it is always advisable to use double-headed irrigation systems in a closed circuit so as to provide water under pressure to both ends of the main line with the capillaries. In this way the pressure gradient along the line is minimal. Systems with micro-/minisprinklers Microsprinkler systems have some of the advantages of both drip- and sprinkler- irrigation systems. Sprinklers are conventionally classified as follows: • microsprinklers (flow rate 30–150 litres/hour) • minisprinklers (flow rate 150–350 litres/hour) The sprinklers require operating pressures of approximately 1.5–2 bar and have emission holes calibrated between 0.8 and 2.3 mm. Therefore the flow rates are considerably higher than those used with the drippers and the infiltration rate (i.e. the rate at which the soil is able to absorb irrigation water) is slightly lower. Also the sprinklers can be standard-type or self-compensating, with the same", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Therefore the flow rates are considerably higher than those used with the drippers and the infiltration rate (i.e. the rate at which the soil is able to absorb irrigation water) is slightly lower. Also the sprinklers can be standard-type or self-compensating, with the same features as described for the drippers. FIGURE 2 Flow rate of each drip point (at a constant pressure of 1.4 bar) depending on the length of the capillary tube and its section Capillary length (m) Internal diameter (mm) Flow rate (litres/hour per capillary) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 154 These systems can be divided as follows: • Dynamic, if they have parts that move during irrigation (also called microsprinklers or minisprinklers, depending on the flow rates) providing a circular wetting area with a greater radius than other systems. • Static (no moving parts), also known as sprayers, able to provide wetting areas of different shapes (circular, semicircular, sectors). The sprinklers can be mounted directly on the main lines or on branch lines, hanging from the tube itself or carried on rods inserted into the ground. Different combinations correspond to different irrigation needs or farm management, but may greatly influence the quality and the efficiency of irrigation. Sprinklers can be used to combine irrigation and protection from frost, provided that the irrigation system is automated. This practice is recommended in areas exposed to moderate, but dangerous spring frosts. Sprinklers that produce droplets with a large diameter are more efficient at transferring heat to the atmosphere and increasing the air temperature. Subsurface drip irrigation Subsurface drip irrigation refers to the use of drip hoses positioned underground at a certain depth. This system consents to directly wet the underground root zone and reduce the evaporative water loss at the soil surface (higher water-use efficiency). The main advantages of this system are as follows: • System permanently placed at a depth > 15 cm and no labour required for disposal or replacement of the system. • Reduced air humidity below the vegetation and consequent limited disease occurrence and weed development. • Higher water irrigation efficiency (no losses due to evaporation and wind drift). • Improved fertigation with nutrients distributed close to the root systems. • Total practicability of the soil during irrigation. • Possibility to use wastewater (no contact with soil surface or aerial part of the plants). However, the technique is not fully implemented, as uncertainties regarding certain technical aspects remain: • It cannot be used to promote germination or rooting. • The costs are still high. • Soil tillage needs to be more superficial. • Powerful filtering is required because of very low flow rates at the drip points. • Clogging of drippers or broken lines is not immediately visible. • There is the possibility of intrusion of roots inside the emitter. 8. Microirrigation 155 MICROIRRIGATION, WATER EFFICIENCY AND WATER SAVINGS The performances of an irrigation method, or an irrigation system at field level or larger areas, are given by the ratio between the amount of water used by the crop and the volume of water distributed (given to the crop). Irrigation efficiency For an assessment of the irrigation efficiency, it is advisable to refer to the overall efficiency of irrigation (IE), i.e. the ratio between the volume of water held in the soil layer and usable by the crop and the water taken from the water source. Provided that a correct evaluation of the useful layer is defined, the overall efficiency is the result of different efficiencies that are encountered during the water transport from the source to the crop: FIGURE 3 A schematic microirrigation system Eisenhauer et al., 2002 (adapted) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 156 • DE (delivery efficiency) – the ratio between the volume of water delivered to the farm and the volume of water taken at the source (typically a river, lake or groundwater). • FE (farm efficiency) – the ratio between the water volume that the farm distributes on irrigated land and the volume of water delivered to the farm or taken directly from a water source of the farm. • WE (watering efficiency) – also", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The overall irrigation efficiency IE is reached by combining the different efficiencies (Figure 4): Compared with other common irrigation methods, such as surface irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, microirrigation is the most efficient. Surface irrigation is the most inefficient (IE < 40%). With sprinkler and mechanized irrigation, the IE ranges from 60 to 85%. With microirrigation, IE can reach 90–95% in well- FIGURE 4 Overall irrigation efficiency Water from source Water at farm level Water at field level Crop Delivery efficiency Farm efficiency Distribution efficiency Losses Losses Losses Overall irrigation efficiency 𝐼𝐼𝐸𝐸= 𝐷𝐷𝐸𝐸× 𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸× 𝑊𝑊𝐸𝐸 8. Microirrigation 157 designed systems, equipped with emitters of good constructive characteristics and used properly (i.e. with irrigation frequency and volume appropriate to both the crop and the soil). In principle, a good microirrigation system can enable the achievement of rational water use, high uniformity of distribution and high efficiency of application; it is also cost-effective. It requires: good system design, water application near the plants and high irrigation frequency, small volumes of watering distributed over long delivery times and low pressures. There follow examples of how water savings can be achieved by improving efficiency. Case 1 Greenhouse farms not technically advanced, with (for various reasons) drip irrigation systems with relatively low efficiency (70%). Intervention to bring efficiency to 90% would result in the following savings: For every 100 m³ of net irrigation requirements of the crop: with 70% efficiency, gross volume required = 100/0.7 m³ = 142.9 m³ with 90% efficiency, gross volume required = 100/0.9 m³ = 111.1 m³ saving = 31.7 m³ (i.e. 22.5%) With the water saved it is possible to irrigate 28.6% of additional surface. Irrigation requirements for a crop with net seasonal volume of 3 000 m³/ha: seasonal saving = 3 000/0.7 – 3 000/0.9 = 4 285.7 – 3 333.3 = 952.4 m³/ha Case 2 Technically advanced greenhouse farms using good drip irrigation systems (IE 85%). There is still margin for improvement. For every 100 m³ of net irrigation requirements of the crop: with 85% efficiency, gross volume required = 100/0.85 m³ = 117.6 m³ with 90% efficiency, gross volume required = 100/0.9 m³ = 105.2 m³ saving = 12.4 m³ (i.e. 10.5.5%) With the water saved it is possible to irrigate 11.8% of additional surface. Irrigation requirements for a crop with net seasonal volume of 3 000 m³/ha: seasonal saving = 3 000/0.85 – 3 000/0.95 = 3 529.4 – 3 157.9 = 371.5 m³/ha Also in the second case, the potential benefit is appreciable. Improvement in efficiency can produce a substantial increase in the availability of water and this may be of fundamental relevance in situations of water scarcity. With microirrigation, uneven distribution is often the main cause of inefficiency. The distribution uniformity (DU) is defined by the ratio (expressed as %) between GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 158 the average flow rate of one-quarter of drippers with the lower flow rates and the average flow rate of all the drippers. DU: > 87% excellent distribution uniformity 75–87% good uniformity 62–75% acceptable < 62% unacceptable The consequence of non-uniform distribution of flow rates is explained in Figure 5, which shows the water penetration into the ground along a drip line.

The qualitative classification of the emitters is reported according to the CV identified experimentally. It is suggested to adopt dispensers with a CV below 5%. CV for point source emitters: < 5% very good 5–10% good 10–15% poor > 15% unacceptable An example of a coefficient of variation CV is shown in Figure 6, which describes the flow rates of two models of emitter, both with an average flow rate of 4 litres/hour, but with different technological uniformity. The first model has a CV of 2.7%, and is classified as “very good”, showing almost equivalent flow rates among emitters tested; the second has a CV of 17.4%, classified as unacceptable, with very different flow rates among emitters. In self-compensating FIGURE 6 Differences of coefficient of uniformity (CV) in models of emitters with average flow rate of 4 litres/hour Flow rate (litres/hour) CV 2.7% CV 17.4% Mannini, 2004 (adapted) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 160 emitters, in addition to the technological uniformity of flow rates and the CV, it is necessary to consider the “tolerance to variations in pressure”, i.e. the ability to effectively maintain unchanged flow rates at different pressure. The following is the classification of “tolerance to pressure variations” according to “x” in the relationship: Q = k Hx (pressure Q and flow rate H) of a self-compensating emitter. The higher the value of x, the lower the compensation of the model. A model with a value of x close to 0.5 is actually a frequently used emitter. x for self-compensating emitters: 0–0.05 very good 0.05–0.10 good 0.10–0.15 moderate > 0.15 poor To obtain high DU and a real self-compensation, it is therefore necessary to use emitters characterized by a CV below 5% and x < 0.05. How to maintain high efficiency Although microirrigation, and in particular drip irrigation, have the potential for a very efficient, rational and economical use of irrigation water, it must be operated with caution. Frequent problems that may reduce the efficiency of the system arise from heterogeneity of flow between the emitters and excessive water localization and deep percolation. Heterogeneity of flow between the emitters The uniformity of water distribution in the field with drip irrigation may reach values well above 90 percent, especially with drip irrigation of crops at low plant density, where each plant is dependent on one or a few drippers. Poor uniformity of the flow rate between the drippers may: • prevent precise measurement of the water distributed, forcing farmers to meet the needs of those plants receiving less water by overirrigating other plants (consequently water percolation and damage to the crop will occur); • result in heterogeneous plant growth with competitive phenomena (implying higher harvest costs); • prevent irrigation with specific water volumes estimated through the crop water balance; or • make it impossible to carry out efficient fertigation. 8.

Microirrigation 161 Obtaining and maintaining high DU among the drippers requires the selection of emitters with high technological characteristics of uniformity of flow rate among the parts to be installed in the field and, in the case of self-compensating drippers, also good tolerance to pressure variations, conditions that must remain unchanged over time. Technical, agronomic and economic assumptions on which the realization of the microirrigation system is based may be jeopardized if these requirements are not met. Uniformity of flow over time can also be achieved by avoiding obstructions or clogging of emitters by means of filtration and chemical treatment of the water. The presence of material in suspension or in solution in the irrigation water is a major cause of failure of irrigation, since this will clog the emitters. Factors that contribute to clogging of emitters are physical (suspended solids), chemical (precipitated salts) and biological (bacteria and algae). They may cause obstructions that must be carefully evaluated to determine whether it is possible or not to use a microirrigation system. In the presence of a high potential risk of obstruction, the water filtration becomes very complicated, expensive and often useless, and it may be advisable to switch to other irrigation methods. The filtration of irrigation water is always absolutely necessary to avoid partial or total obstructions of the emitters in the field, capable of compromising completely the uniformity of water distribution, with all the negative effects already described, including loss of efficiency and waste of water. In this respect, the heart of the microirrigation system consists of the station of water filtration dimensioned according to the quality of available water and the sensitivity to clogging of the emitters. Usually, emitters with a lower flow rate have smaller passages and are therefore more sensitive to clogging. The efficiency of the filtering station is, therefore, crucial for the maintenance over time of the uniformity of water distribution. The following are the main types of filter: • hydrocyclone filters • sand filters • screen (strainer) filters • disc filters The choice among different types depends mainly on the material in suspension in the water, which implies that coupling different types of filters may be required in some cases. For a correct choice of the type of filter, and relative filtration intensity, it is necessary to consider the diameter of both orifices and labyrinths of the emitters, the water quality and the flow rate to be filtered. The narrower the water passageways in microemitters, the finer the filtering material. Approximately the relationship between flow rate and passageway diameter is: 1 litre/hour, GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 162 0.7 mm; 2 litres/hour, 0.8 mm; 4 litres/hour, 1 mm; 8 litres/hour, 1.4 mm. In sand filters, disc filters and screen filters, the intensity of filtration is expressed as a function of the dimensions of the spaces left free for water passage. In general, filtering material with passages with a diameter below 1/7–1/10 the diameter of the orifice of the emitter is commonly used. Therefore particles passing through the filter will not block the emitter. When the material in the irrigation water is in solution, filtering becomes ineffective. In these cases, the ordinary maintenance of the irrigation system must include chemical treatments inside the lines with chlorine or acid, able to avoid the clogging of the emitters. Chlorination can be performed in one of the following modes: • continuous – to prevent the growth of algae or bacteria or to precipitate the iron present in the water, with a concentration of 1–2 mg/litre; • intermittent – to control excessive developments of micro-organisms or sludge, with concentrations of 10–20 mg/litre for about 1 hour; • suppressing (superchlorination) – to dissolve concretions of organic material that clog the emitters, by injecting chlorine with concentrations up to 500 mg/litre. The injection of acid lowers the pH of the water in order to avoid precipitation of suspended solids such as carbonates and iron. The acid is also used, if necessary, to increase", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The acid is also used, if necessary, to increase the effective antiseptic action of chlorine for the control of micro-organisms. Water excess and deep percolation While in sprinkler irrigation the entire soil surface is wet, the characteristic of microirrigation is to bring water in small volumes distributed at high frequency. Excessive localization can, however, result in reduced efficiency of microirrigation, for two main reasons: • too low ratio between plant roots and volume of wet soil • deep percolation for continuous supply of high water volumes (on a limited area of land) The choice of an adequate number of emitters and their specific watering volume is not simple, but it should be made taking into account both the crop water requirements and the quantity of water storable in the useful layer of roots by different types of soil. The shape and the extension of wetted area below the drip points depends on the hydrological characteristics of the soil, the flow rate of the dripper and the water volume delivered (Figure 7). Regardless of the number of drippers, the soil volume moistened by each dripper is very limited on sandy soils and higher on clayey soils. In the latter situation, the volume of wet soil will be greater, with increased water contact with the root systems and less risk of deep 8. Microirrigation 163 water loss (percolation). Too abundant and frequent volumes in the root zone, however, lead to saturation of the soil, nullifying the soil capacity to retain water and causing deep percolation. In relation to the flow rate delivered by the drip point, the diameter of the wetted area (D, metres) increases with increasing values of the flow rate (F, litres/ hour) according to the following relationships: • sandy soil: D = 0.12F + 0.31 • loamy soil: D = 0.11F + 0.68 • clayey soil: D = 0.10F + 1.19 As the volume delivered increases, the water tends to deepen into the soil without substantially increasing the diameter of the wetted area. Particularly in very sandy soils, it is necessary to irrigate with a very high frequency, with a long duration of watering (so that plants may consume a significant fraction of the water supplied during the watering time) and to use a good number of drippers in order to fractionate the water volume in a greater soil volume. In these soils, a high number of emitters of low unitary flow rate is the best solution since it makes better use of the water storage capacity of the soil, supplies the water over a longer time and enables a greater volume of wet soil to come into contact with the roots. On sandy soils the frequency of irrigation may also be daily, returning to the crop the water evapotranspired the previous day. In the case of crops with high water consumption, subdividing the volume during the day is recommended.

With maintenance, it is sufficient to adopt rules of common sense, for example, flashing sufficient clear water in drip lines at the end of the fertigation, emptying drip lines regularly, taking prompt action to repair accidental breakage or slipping out of the pipes, maintaining the functionality of the filters. With regard to the agronomic aspects, it is first necessary to consider the characteristics of drip irrigation that aim to provide water “continuously and constantly” (i.e. providing a gradual restitution of the water consumed by the crop, maintaining high levels of moisture in the wet zone of the soil where the roots are active). Limiting the oscillation of the soil water content between the field capacity and no less than 75 percent of the water usable by the plants would be to the benefit of the crop and improve the efficiency of the delivered water. Indeed, the gradual reintegration of water consumption involves frequent watering with low volumes which can be (almost) completely retained in the soil layer explored by the roots. Conversely, increasing the time intervals between the irrigations, involves the supply of higher volumes, part of which will go below the rootzone and therefore be wasted. The choice of the correct water volume, in relation to the characteristics of the soil and the plant root systems, is therefore important for reducing water losses. The water volume must refer to the wet surface, taking into account the diameter of the area wetted by each drip point. As already mentioned in the previous paragraph, this depends not only on the soil type but also on the flow rate delivered by the drip point. On this basis, the following relationships show the approximate water volume (V, litres) retained in a soil layer of 40 cm, in three different types of soil, irrigating at 75 percent of the water usable by the crops (F = flow rate of drip points, litres/hour). • sandy soil: V = 1.50F + 0.53 • loamy soil: V = 3.93F + 7.62 • clayey soil: V = 5.71F + 27.69 8. Microirrigation 165 From these relationships it can be seen that, with drip points of a flow rate of 1 litre/hour, the retained soil water goes from a volume of about 2 litres on sandy soil to 33 litres on clayey soil, while on loamy soil the water volume retained in the first 40 cm is just above 11 litres. It is evident that in a sandy soil, for example, with volumes greater than 2 litres per drip point, corresponding to operating times of over 2 hours, a part of the water percolates below a depth of 40 cm, where it cannot be easily used by plants. Therefore, in sandy soil it is absolutely necessary to irrigate frequently with low volumes. Even in clay soils, which could retain much higher water volumes in the same soil layer, it is advisable to irrigate with short time intervals, and consequently low volumes, to limit the phenomena of soil shrinkage, water loss and crop damage. For good irrigation management, it is essential to know the crop water requirements in relation to the weather conditions and the phase of plant development, according to the methods and criteria reported herein.

This is particularly true in Mediterranean countries, where growers increasingly face problems associated with low quality water. In this chapter the most important water physical and chemical quality parameters are discussed. These include pH, alkalinity and salinity. Furthermore, a review of the criteria for water quality assessment is presented. Water tests to be conducted prior to selecting a greenhouse site are also briefly described with reference to the official methods of water analysis. The presence of high soluble salts in irrigation water is one of the most limiting factors in greenhouse crop production. As an alternative to using seawater – a common practice in some Mediterranean areas (e.g. Almería, Spain) – wastewater from industrial processes or lower grade water from wells contaminated by seawater infiltrations can be used. Management and agronomic techniques that may be used to combat some of the problems associated with the use of these “waters” are discussed, including methods to correct poor quality irrigation water. IRRIGATION WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS The characteristics of irrigation water depend on the source. Irrigation water can be classified on the basis of its origin as: • surface water (from rivers, canals, natural or artificial lakes); • subterranean water (from springs, wells etc.); • wastewater (from urban and industrial drains, subjected to various kinds of purification treatments). GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 170 For example, subterranean water in coastal zones may be of marginal quality for agricultural use owing to the high dissolved salt content, and municipal wastewater also, because of the associated health hazards. The parameters characterizing irrigation water quality can be divided into three categories: • Physical: temperature, suspended solids (soil particles, impurities etc.) • Chemical: gaseous substances, pH, soluble salts, hardness, sodium and chloride concentration etc. • Biological: algae, bacteria, various micro-organisms Physical parameters Temperature For irrigation purposes, the water temperature must be as close as possible to that of the plants and the layer of substrate containing the root systems. Low temperature water contributes to modify the soil temperature (Wierenga et al., 1971) which, in turn, reduces the root activity in terms of water and nutrient uptake from and to the roots (of carbohydrates and of growth metabolites, respectively). Low temperature water could also induce water stress by increasing the gap between plant transpiration and water uptake (Langridge, 1963). For horticultural crops, water can be considered cold when its temperature is less than three-quarters that of the air (Barbieri and De Pascale, 1991). In tomato, it has been proposed that reduced rates of mineral transport are responsible for slow growth at cool root temperature (Davies and Lingle, 1961). Cold water can cause physiological disorders, especially in more delicate crops; water can be stored in basins to encourage the temperature to rise. Warm water can be used advantageously to warm crops as well as supply water needs; however, water at a temperature of over 35 °C is dangerous to plants. Water temperature can affect the end product: particularly in the cultivation of foliage plants, unsuitable temperatures can cause leaf spotting, which reduces product value. Suspended solids Solid substances of varying origin may be found in the water: • Soil particles as a result of erosion. • Very fine dispersion of clay, silicate and carbonate materials from the concrete, refractory, ceramic and glass industries. • Different types of suspended matter disposed of in watercourses by various industries. • Particulates contained in unpurified or partially purified municipal wastewater. 9.

Problems may arise when plants and commercial products are stained, leading to their depreciation in terms of health, hygiene and appearance – particularly important in the case of flower crops. However, solid substances suspended in irrigation water are more likely to damage the irrigation equipment. High solid matter content can lead to sedimentation of the suspended matter, blocking the equipment; this alters the waterflow, reducing the efficiency of the distribution networks and increasing the need for maintenance.

There may be indirect damage to crops due to shortcomings caused by insufficient water availability and blockage of the distribution equipment, especially drip emitters. The problem of solid matter in irrigation water should be tackled in relation to the distribution method used. Microirrigation systems characterized by a high number of distribution points with small orifices and small-diameter tubes are more susceptible to blockages. The problem worsens when the water also contains agents causing blockages. An assessment of the blockage risk in relation to the presence of these substances is shown in Table 1. Matter suspended in wastewater may include variable quantities of organic substances, leading to water distribution problems. Moreover, the use of wastewater containing suspended organic solids can lead to health and hygiene hazards. Pollution by natural organic substances is the most frequent form of surface water contamination and is due to urban drains, livestock farming and industry (for example, the food industry). The organic substances in the water begin to decay, leading to the increasingly fast breakdown of the original matter and the formation of very simple end compounds, such as carbon TABLE 1 Influence of water quality on the potential for clogging problems in localized (drip) irrigation systems.

Nakayama and Bucks, 1991 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 172 dioxide, nitrates, sulphates and phosphates. Organic substances are primarily broken down by oxidizing bacteria. Their proliferation can lead to a dramatic reduction in the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water. The intensity of these processes is regulated by climatic and environmental conditions. Normally, high concentrations of natural organic substances in the water are accompanied by other pollutants, particularly pathogenic germs. Filtration is designed to eliminate suspended solid matter of mineral or organic origin. In summary, suspended solids such as soil particles are potential problems since they can clog the irrigation nozzle and cause abrasion of irrigation equipment. Obstruction of emitters caused by the presence of solid particles in the water raises the cost and increases the maintenance of trickle irrigation systems, and can compromise their utilization. Chemical parameters Oxygen and other gaseous components The presence of oxygen in the water is influenced by temperature and by the presence of biodegradable substances. However, its concentration is always restrained by the low solubility of air in water; for this reason, rainwater and surface water are to be preferred. CO2, H2S, SO2 and CH4 can also be found in their gaseous state and their presence can restrict water-use potential. The chlorine used to purify drinking water is sometimes present in gaseous form, but becomes volatile when in contact with the environment due to the combined action of light and air. pH The pH expresses the concentration of hydrogen ions (protons; H+) in an aqueous solution. More specifically, the term, which derives from the French pouvoir hydrogène (power of hydrogen), is defined as the cologarithm (to the base 10) of the concentration (in moles per litre) of H+ ions with the sign changed: The pH can vary on a scale from 0 to 14 with a pH of 7 being neutral, less than 7 acid and above 7 basic or alkaline.

The pH of water, together with that of soil or the different cultivation substrates, influences the solubility of the various ionic species and, therefore, the nutrition provided by the medium. In fact, every nutritional element has a maximum solubility for clearly defined pH intervals. The optimum pH of irrigation water is commonly between 6.5 and 7.5; the minimum acceptable limit is 5.0. At lower pH levels, the presence of free acids can also cause direct damage to the root system of the crops. The reaction of the water can influence that of the substrate. Prolonged use of the same substrate causes the pH to move away from 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝= −𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙10[𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝+] 9. Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 173 optimum levels, generally in an upward direction; this phenomenon increases with the use of alkaline waters resulting from the presence of carbonates. If the pH difference is not excessive, the substrate can counter this type of change through buffer power. As with cation exchange capacity, the buffer power varies greatly according to the type of substrate and is extremely low in some inert substrates. Water with a pH of 6.0–8.5 can be used for irrigation purposes. Decidedly acid (pH < 5) or basic (pH > 8.5) water is classified as anomalous for irrigation purposes. A reaction that differs significantly from neutrality always indicates an anomaly, such as the presence of certain salts. Alkalinity The term alkaline (pH > 7) is different from the term alkalinity (capacity to change or resist a change in pH). It is not uncommon to have irrigation water with a pH of 7.5 (alkaline), but with a low alkalinity value acceptable for growing plants. While pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration, alkalinity is a relative measurement of water’s capacity to resist a change in pH or its ability to change the pH of the growing media. Chemically, this is expressed in parts per million (ppm) of calcium carbonate equivalents (CaCO3). Bicarbonates (HCO3-), carbonates (CO32-) and hydroxyl ions (OH-) are the primary chemicals contributing to the The pH is an indicator of the acidity or basicity of a water, but is seldom a problem by itself. The main use of pH in a water analysis is for detecting an abnormal water. The normal pH range for irrigation water is from 6.5 to 8.4. An abnormal value is a warning that the water needs further evaluation. Irrigation water with a pH outside the normal range may cause a nutritional imbalance or may contain a toxic ion. Low salinity water (electrical conductivity of water, ECw < 0.2 dS/m) sometimes has a pH outside the normal range since it has a very low buffering capacity. This should not cause undue alarm other than to alert the user to a possible imbalance of ions and the need to establish the reason for the adverse pH through full laboratory analysis. Such water normally causes few problems for soils or crops but is very corrosive and may rapidly corrode pipelines, sprinklers and control equipment. Any change in the soil pH caused by the water will take place slowly since the soil is strongly buffered and resists change. An adverse pH may need to be corrected, if possible, by the introduction of an amendment into the water, but this will only be practical in a few instances. It may be easier to correct the soil pH problem that may develop rather than try to treat the water. Lime is commonly applied to the soil to correct a low pH and sulphur or other acid material may be used to correct a high pH. Gypsum has little or no effect in controlling an acid soil problem apart from supplying a nutritional source of calcium, but it is effective in reducing a high soil pH (pH greater than 8.5) caused by high exchangeable sodium. The greatest direct hazard of an abnormal pH in water is the impact on irrigation equipment. Equipment will need to be chosen carefully for unusual water.

Water quality for agriculture, FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 29 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 174 alkalinity of water. Alkalinity increases as the amount of dissolved carbonates and bicarbonates rises. Irrigation water with high alkalinity (e.g. 400 ppm CaCO3) will tend to raise the pH of the growing media over time and require more acid to lower the pH of the water to an acceptable level if desired (Table 2). Water with a high alkalinity (e.g. > 100 ppm CaCO3) requires a grower to consider using acid-type soluble fertilizers rather than calcium-based fertilizers. Acid injection is commonly used to manage water with high alkalinity. Salinity (total soluble salts) One of the most important characteristics of irrigation water is salinity. The salinity of water is simply direct evidence of dissociation of soluble mineral salts.1 The higher a salt’s concentration the more it contributes to salinity, particularly if dissociated. The most frequently found are nitrates, chlorides, sulphates, carbonates and bicarbonates of alkaline and alkaline earth elements (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium). Some individual elements (e.g. boron, chlorine, sodium) have equally important effects. When determining irrigation water suitability criteria, particular reference is made to: • the total concentration of salts in the solution; • the relative ratio of sodium (Na) to the other cations; • the concentration of specific ions which may be toxic to plants (e.g. boron, chloride and sodium). The use of unsuitable water (in terms of the quantity or quality of salts present) for irrigation purposes has a negative effect on the overall soil-water- plant relationship, sometimes even drastically restricting the normal physiological activity and productive capacity of the crops. Salinity can be measured by means of analytical or electrical conductivity methods. In the case of analytical measurements, salinity is expressed as the 1 Soluble salts may dissociate in water to form charged ions. If the ion carries a positive charge (+), it is called a cation. If it carries a negative charge (-), it is called an anion. The most common cations of interest in water are calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and sodium (Na+); the most common anions are bicarbonate (HCO3-), chloride (Cl-) and sulphate (SO42-). An electric conductivity meter simply measures the total relative amount of either the dissolved anions or the dissolved cations. Pure water, with few or no dissolved salts, is a poor conductor of electrons and the electrical conductivity value is very low or approaching zero. Interestingly, urea dissolved in water to make a fertilizer solution does not dissociate so it cannot be monitored adequately using an EC meter.

Water is defined as brackish when it has total salt content (fixed solids or total dissolved salts) of 2 g/litre (or 2 000 ppm) or more.2 Electrical conductivity methods take into account the osmotic pressure that a given saline concentration creates in the solution; the salinity index adopted in this case is electrical conductivity (EC): the unit of measurement was for many years the mho3 and, more specifically, the millimho per centimetre (mmho/ cm) and micromho per centimetre (μmho/cm) at 25 °C, where 1 mmho/ cm = 1 000 μmho/cm. The metric equivalent for mho is Siemens, or milliSiemens per centimetre (mS/cm) or microSiemens/cm (μS/cm), where 1 mho/cm = 1 mS/ cm = 1 000 μS/cm. Scientific literature generally uses deciSiemens per metre (dS/m) to measure conductivity, with mS/cm and μS/cm the established and accepted units of measurement for water salinity, where 1 dS/m = 1mS/cm = 1 000 μS/cm as measured by a conductivity meter.

Water is defined as brackish when the EC is 3.0 dS/m or more (at 25 °C). It is possible to switch from one unit to the other by consulting specific tables or using formulae (Table 3).4 On the basis of electrical conductivity levels, water classification schemes have been proposed in order to identify classes of irrigation water (Table 4) and the salinity hazard of the irrigation water (Table 5). Salinity hazard Use of saline irrigation water can lead to three types of problem: • increase in the osmotic potential of the circulating solution (osmotic effect) with increasing water absorption problems for the plants (physiological drought); • effects of the chemistry and physics of the substrate; • phytotoxicity. 2 A more complete analytical index is provided by meq/litre. The meq/litre is calculated by dividing the ppm by the equivalent weight (EW) of the respective ion. The equivalent weight of one ion is calculated as the molecular weight divided by its valence. For example, with sodium, the EW is 23 (molecular weight of 23 divided by the valence, which is 1). If the concentration of sodium is 100 ppm, the concentration expressed in meq/litre is 4.3. 3 The basis for this unit came from the ohm, which is the unit used to measure electrical resistance. A 1-ohm resistance with 1 volt across it will conduct 1 ampere of electrical current. The electrical equation is: V (volts) = I (ampere) × R (resistance) where R is measured in ohms. The reciprocal of resistance is conductance, measured in mho (ohm spelt backwards). 4 The total salt content or total dissolved solids (TDS) is usually in ppm; it is calculated from the EC value (EC in mS/cm is multiplied by 640) to obtain total dissolved solids in ppm. For example, EC of 1.6 mS/cm (1.6 × 640) = 1 024 ppm. The meq/litre of total salts can also be estimated by multiplying the EC (mS/cm) by 10. For example, EC of 2.62 mS/cm × 10 = 26.2 meq/litre. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 176 Saline stress physiology The presence of salt in the circulating solution can inhibit growth for two reasons: • Salt in the soil reduces the availability of water for uptake by plants, leading to reduced growth. This factor is called the “osmotic effect”. • If an excessive quantity of salt enters the transpiratory flow of the plant, the cells will be damaged by the “phytotoxic effect”. The osmotic effect reduces leaf development and growth of the root system, reducing stomatal conductance and, as a result, photosynthesis.

Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 177 cellular processes are similar to those relative to water stress. Normally salts are not absorbed by growing tissues at concentrations that can inhibit growth. In fact, meristematic tissue is largely supplied with nutrients through the phloem, from which salts are excluded. Furthermore, expanding cells can exclude incoming salts through the xylematic (sap) flow by means of vacuolar compartmentation. In this way, the salts reaching the plant do not directly inhibit the growth of new tissue. However, the presence of salts enhances leaf senescence. Continuous transport in fully transpiring leaves leads to a high buildup of ions such as Na+ and Cl-, with early tissue death. If new leaves manage to replace the old dead leaves, the photosynthetic process remains unaltered and the plant can produce normally. Otherwise, yield reduction will occur. Reduction in growth comprises two phases: • When stress begins, the reduction appears as a consequence of the osmotic effect due to the presence of ions outside the roots. • Subsequently, tissues are damaged and leaf senescence occurs; the rate at which old leaves die depends on the rate at which the ions are accumulated.

Assessing salinity tolerance There is a linear relationship between the salinity of the soil and plant production, expressed as follows (Mass and Hoffman model, Maas and Hoffman, 1977): where: P is the crop production compared with the maximum possible production in optimal conditions (%) EC is the mean electrical conductivity of a saturated paste taken from the rootzone (in mS/cm or in dS/m) a is the salinity threshold expressed in mS/cm (or in dS/m) b is the slope expressed in percent per mS/cm (or in dS/m) Obviously, some species are more tolerant to salt than others. Tolerance is usually linked to the percentage of biomass produced in saline soil compared with non-saline soil, after permitting growth for an extended period of time. For ornamental species, quantity of flowers and presence of aesthetically perfect leaves are also considerations. Various studies have attempted to classify the degree of tolerance5 of cultivated species to salinity. Table 6 shows the degree of tolerance to salinity in different vegetable crops. Irrigation water, particularly if the source is from groundwater, usually contains some amount of dissolved salts. Some of these dissolved salts (sodium, chloride, boron, fluoride and iron) are of greater concern to growers than others. Soluble solids are a concern since they are either directly toxic to the plants, impede the uptake of water by the roots or cause foliar spotting that lowers the overall value of the plants. Water high in soluble salts may be referred to as saline. Total soluble salts are easily measured by monitoring the electrical conductivity (EC) of the solution.

For example tomatoes have a better colour and increased total soluble solids, while melons display improved organoleptic characteristics. 9. Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 179 While much progress has been made in the classification of the various plant species on the basis of their level of tolerance to salinity, the latter is highly variable depending on genotype, soil and climate conditions and the agronomic techniques used. In particular, the adoption of suitable agronomic strategies, in association with careful selection of the species and cultivar, would make it possible to minimize reductions in yield. This regards in particular salinity control in the root zone, especially during germination and the early phenological phases. This can be achieved by increasing irrigation frequency or satisfying the leaching requirement. Toxic elements The presence of particular ions in the water can cause phytotoxicity problems – direct toxicity for various physiological processes of the plant or nutritional imbalances – with different levels of tolerance in different plants. Toxicity problems arise when elements in the irrigation water build up in the plant tissue to such an extent as to cause reductions in yield, independently of the total solute concentration. Elements capable of generating toxicity phenomena are chlorine, sulphur, boron, sodium and ammonium. Toxicity phenomena manifest themselves in a typical fashion for each element and are apparent on old leaves where the buildup is greater. High sodium (Na) is of concern to growers since it can contribute to salinity problems, interfere with magnesium and calcium availability in the media and cause foliar burns. Sulphur (S) and chlorine (Cl) are essential elements for plant growth. Some crops (cruciferous, leguminous, potatoes) remove significant quantities of sulphur (70 kg ha-1). However, if large quantities of this element are present in the irrigation water, it can damage the crops as a result of direct toxicity. Sulphur is generally found in water in the form of sulphate (SO42-). However, in reducing environments, sulphates can be converted into sulphides (SO3-) which have higher phytotoxic action; indeed, sulphides cause the precipitation of iron, leading to toxicity symptoms in plants.

(2013) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 180 Chloride (Cl-) in water derives from the dissociation of the chloride salts contained in the water and the chlorination (Cl2) of purified wastewater. Elevated chloride is often associated with an elevated sodium concentration. Cl- is not absorbed by the soil, but moves easily within the circulating solution, from which it is absorbed by the roots, building up in the leaves. At high concentrations, it can interfere with the absorption of nitrates and the transport of organic acids within and between cells. Symptoms of toxicity from chloride appear as burning and drying of leaf tissue (starting at the tips and continuing along the edges), browning, premature yellowing and leaf drop (Table 7). For most non-woody species, tolerance to chloride can be estimated on the basis of the threshold values given in the salinity tolerance tables (Table 8): assuming that the salinity consists primarily of chloride salts, by multiplying the threshold values in dS/m by 10 we obtain the approximate concentrations of Cl- in mol/m³ in the irrigation water or in the soil saturation extract, which can then be multiplied by 35.4 to calculate the concentrations in g/m³. The potential for chlorides and sulphates to cause damage depends on the sensitivity of the irrigated species and primarily manifests itself when the vegetation is wetted (i.e. sprinkler irrigation). Boron (B) is an essential element for plant life, but it can be toxic even at very low concentrations. Generally speaking, toxic concentrations of boron are almost exclusively found in soils in arid zones and in well and spring water in geothermal and volcanic regions, while most surface water contains acceptable levels of boron. Significant quantities of boron may be TABLE 7 Chloride hazard of irrigation water Chlorides (meq/l) Chlorides (ppm) General notesa < 2.0 < 70 Generally safe for all plants 2.1–4.0 71–140 Sensitive plants usually show slight to moderate injury 4.1–10.0 140–350 Moderately tolerant plants usually show slight to substantial injury > 10.0 > 350 Severe problems a Most annual crops and short-lived perennials are moderately to highly tolerant to chlorides, and managers can rely on the salinity hazard index to evaluate water-use problems.

Maas, 1990 (Tables 7 and 8) 9. Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 181 found in irrigation water due to outflows from residential purification plants, as this element is contained in household detergents in the form of sodium perborate. Levels of 0.2–0.5 mg/litre are considered normal in irrigation water. However, levels of above 0.3 can be harmful to sensitive crops. Irrigation water with a boron content of over 4.0 mg/litre is unsuitable for almost all crops. Plants have different levels of tolerance ranging between the two extreme values. The toxic effects of boron are initially apparent in old leaves in the form of yellowing, chlorotic spots or dried tissue at the tip and edges of the leaf. Plant age also influences susceptibility or the extent of the problem. Seedlings are generally more susceptible than mature plants of the same species (Table 9). Management strategies to minimize boron problems when the water source is high include eliminating boron from the fertilizer sources, increasing the media pH and increasing the calcium level (Table 10). Well water is sometimes particularly rich in iron (Fe). Acid-loving plants may experience problems when irrigated with ferrous water and are therefore grown in acid soil or substrates. In an acidic environment, iron in the form of ferrous ions does not precipitate, but increases its concentration in solution and can be toxic. Elevated iron levels generally cause aesthetic problems to plants and greenhouse structures. High levels can also lead to an accumulation on irrigation equipment resulting in plugged emitters. Lower levels cause discoloration and higher levels toxicity in plant tissue. Many other elements react with the soil and cannot be removed by means of leaching, resulting in toxic buildups in the soil and in plants, despite the presence of very low concentrations in the irrigation water. These so-called “trace elements” are generally contained in small quantities in water; they behave in a similar fashion and cause similar problems (Table 11). Many of these elements (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, tin and thallium) are so-called heavy metals (with a density of over 5 g/cm3). Heavy metal pollution mostly derives from human activities (industry, traffic). Some are essential for many living organisms, TABLE 9 Boron hazard of irrigation water Boron concentration Susceptible crop injurya < 0.5 ppm Satisfactory for all crops 0.5–1.0 ppm Satisfactory for most crops; sensitive crops may show injury 1.0–2.0 ppm Satisfactory for semi-tolerant crops; sensitive crops are usually reduced in plant vigour > 2.0 ppm Suitable only for tolerant plants a Plants grown in soil high in lime may tolerate more boron than those grown in non-calcareous soils.

When using water with high concentrations of heavy metals, the following risks should be considered: • direct damage caused by phytotoxicity • buildup of the element in the substrate • absorption, transfer and buildup in the plant • diffusion through the food chain TABLE 11 Recommended limits for constituents in reclaimed water for irrigation (mg/litre) Constituent Long-term use Short-term use Remarks Aluminum (Al) 5.0 20 Can cause non-productivity in acid soils, but soils at pH 5.5– 8.0 will precipitate the ion and eliminate toxicity.

Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 183 The devices used to control salinity and sodium levels are also used to control toxicity phenomena. As with all salinity problems, toxicity problems are also increased during the period of greatest environmental evapotranspiration demand, meaning that where good quality water is available, it is best to use it during the hottest period of the irrigation season. Hardness Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are key elements for crops and play a fundamental role in the cation balance of the soil, attenuating the negative effects of sodium. They are generally found in water in the form of ions produced by the dissociation of salts, such as nitrates, chlorides, sulphates, carbonates and bicarbonates. The extent of calcium and magnesium salt content in water is represented by the hardness. Hardness is measured in German and French degrees. One German degree (°dH) corresponds to 10 mg of calcium oxide or 7.19 mg of magnesium oxide per litre of water. One French degree (°f) corresponds to 10 mg of calcium carbonate per litre of water. One French degree therefore consists of 5.6 mg of CaO per litre of water and is therefore around half a German degree. Water hardness is either: • temporary, caused by calcium and magnesium carbonates (eliminated by boiling the water); or • permanent, owing to the presence of calcium and magnesium sulphates, nitrates and chlorides. Water can be classified as: • soft (0–10 °dH; 0–20 °f) • moderate (10–20 °dH; 20–38 °f) • hard (> 20 °dH; > 38 °f) Temporary hardness influences the general nutritional conditions in the substrate, increasing the pH. This can have a negative effect on acidophilic plants (i.e. some ornamental plants). In very acid substrates, hard water can have a positive effect. The ability of plants to resist irrigation water hardness depends on: the buffer power of the substrate, the initial pH and the amount of water used. Generally speaking, in the case of temporary hardness, the upper resistance limit of plants is about 10 °dH or 18 °f. With total hardness, the upper limit is about 20 °dH or 38 °f. Certain flower crops, such as carnations and chrysanthemums, prosper even when irrigated with water with a permanent hardness", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Vice versa, plants that are very sensitive to hardness can even be damaged by water with a hardness of < 10 °dH. High carbonate and bicarbonate content in irrigation water can block water distribution equipment, especially that used in microirrigation (drip emitters, microsprinklers). If the level of carbonates exceeds the limit indicated in the classification, the need to treat the water either physically or chemically should be assessed. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 184 Measures can be taken to improve hard water, for example by adding acids: • concentrated sulphuric acid = 10 cm3/m3 of water for every German degree of temporary hardness • oxalic acid = 22.5 cm3/m3 of water for every German degree of temporary hardness Hardness can also be eliminated through the use of ion exchange resins. This system eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water and replaces them with potassium, sodium and, in some cases, H+ and OH- ions. Trophic substances Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the main elements in plant nutrition. When surface water is enriched with excessive trophic substances, it can lead to an increase in phytomass productivity in the body of water. This phenomenon, known as eutrophication, can lead to a reduction in the concentration of the oxygen in the water, following the deterioration of the organic substance formed in this way, with alterations in the aquatic biocenosis. This form of water pollution is normally attributed to agricultural activity, due to the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilized fields. This may be true in areas characterized by intense livestock farming and the irrational agronomic use of manure. However, considerable quantities of N and P are also introduced into watercourses by residential and industrial purification plants or, worse still, by untreated waste pipes. From an agronomic point of view, the presence of nitrogen in the irrigation water can generally be considered an advantage, as it reduces or eliminates the cost of nitrogen fertilization. However, problems can arise with regard to its quantity and distribution over time. It is therefore recommended to adapt the fertilization to the nutrient quantities contained in the irrigation water, in order to avoid excessive availability of nutrients and their release into the runoff water from the irrigated land. For example: irrigation water N = 50 mg/litre irrigation requirement = 200 mm (=200 litre/m2) 50 mg/litre × 200 litre/m2 = 10 000 mg N/m2 = 10 g N/m2 = 100 kg N/ha of nitrogen supplied by means of irrigation, which should be subtracted from the dose to be distributed through fertigation Excess nutrients in the water and the consequent growth of algae can lead to problems in the water distribution system resulting from the obstruction of the waterflow and the suction lift of the pumps and the blockage of the distributors. In the presence of solid organic matter in suspension, it is advisable to use grit and mesh filters. In some cases, denitrification may be necessary. 9.

Herein are described only those of significance for protected agriculture. Sodium absorption ratio (SAR) Sodium (Na) is absorbed by colloids in the soil and determines deflocculation with important effects on permeability. However, the risk that the sodium contained in the water is effectively absorbed by the soil is reduced by the presence of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg).

Some authors have tried to make the sodium risk assessment more sophisticated by introducing parameters and creating adjusted indices, not relevant herein.6 Chloride/bicarbonate ratio The salinity levels of subterranean water vary during the course of the year, and are generally higher during the dry season. One possible cause of this variation is the intrusion of seawater into the watertable – a phenomenon in many coastal areas where water consumption is very high (due to agriculture, industry, tourism etc.). Seawater, unlike subterranean water, is very rich in chloride ions; subterranean 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆= 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁+ ට𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁2+ + 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀2+ 2 6 Refinement of the SAR called the “Adjusted SAR” (SARa) has recently been developed. SARa includes the added effects of precipitation of calcium in soils as related to CO32- + HCO3- concentrations. If the SARa is less than 6.0 there should be no problems with either sodium or permeability. In the range of 6.0–9.0 there are increasing problems. If the SARa is greater than 9.0, severe problems can be expected. TABLE 12 The sodium hazard of water based on SAR values SAR values Sodium hazard of water Comments 1–10 Low Use on sodium-sensitive crops must be cautioned 10–18 Medium Amendments (such as gypsum) and leaching needed 18–26 High Generally unsuitable for continuous use > 26 Very high Generally unsuitable for use Ayers and Westcot, 1985 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 186 water contains relatively high concentrations of carbonates and bicarbonates. An increase in the chloride ion and carbonate/bicarbonate ion concentration ratio is an indication of possible contamination of the groundwater by seawater. Ionic balance In irrigation water, the sum of the concentrations in meq/litre of the positive ions (cations) is equal to that of the negative ions (anions). It is possible to calculate the ionic balance by expressing the concentrations of the main cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) in meq/litre and summing them. Repeating this operation with the main anions (CO32-, HCO3-, Cl -, SO42-, NO3 -) produces a similar result; if the results differ significantly, an ion present in large quantities has not been included in the analysis, or an error has been made. It is important to remember that the sum of the concentrations (in meq/litre) of the cations C (or the anions A) is empirically linked to the EC from the following expression: pH, alkalinity and water acidification In irrigation practice, especially in fertigation, water is often acidified to reduce incrustations and keep the substrate pH at optimum levels, generally between 5.5 and 6.5 (< 7.0). Although this operation is generally carried out automatically by specific equipment, it is important to be able to calculate the quantity of acid needed to reach the desired pH, as the acids used (nitric, phosphoric and sulphuric) are also fertilizers and it is therefore necessary to know the amount of nutrients added through the acidification process. Rather than the pH of the irrigation water, it is the alkalinity that is important, i.e. the concentration (meq/ litre) of the bicarbonate (HCO3-) and carbonate (CO32-) ions. In fact, as the term alkalinity suggests, it is the alkalinity that determines the amount of acid required to correct the pH. IRRIGATION WATER ANALYSIS: UNITS, TERMS AND SAMPLING Analysis of irrigation water is crucial for greenhouse production in order to avoid phytotoxicity phenomena for crops, rationalize fertilization (especially in the case of fertigation) and decide whether or not to install a special water treatment plant.

IRRIGATION WATER ANALYSIS: UNITS, TERMS AND SAMPLING Analysis of irrigation water is crucial for greenhouse production in order to avoid phytotoxicity phenomena for crops, rationalize fertilization (especially in the case of fertigation) and decide whether or not to install a special water treatment plant. Reference should be made to official analysis methods when analysing water. Sampling Analysis can be performed at any time of year, but water characteristics may vary noticeably on the basis of seasonal rainfall, especially in the case of surface water sources. If there is no information available about the usual conditions of the well, it is best to carry out at least two analyses in order to investigate any changes to the composition of the water: one during a rainy period and the other during a dry period.

Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 187 1–3 years, carrying out periodic pH and electrical conductivity (EC) tests with user- friendly portable instruments – considered an essential part of any farm’s equipment. It is very simple to sample irrigation water, following a few basic rules: • The well must have been made at least a few weeks earlier and must be in regular use; if it has been out of use for some time, it should be used for a few days before sampling. • Before taking the sample, the water should be allowed to flow for a few minutes. • A clean polyethylene bottle with a capacity of at least 1 litre (and filled completely) should be used; however, as some measurements may require a larger volume of water, it is recommended to contact the laboratory in advance for more detailed information. • The sample should be sent to the laboratory as soon as possible, with a label attached including details of the farm and the crop, the name or number used to identify the water source and the type of analysis to be performed. If, for any reason, 1–2 days should pass before sending the sample, it is necessary to contact the laboratory for advice on the best storage methods, which may vary depending on the parameters to be investigated. Analytical parameters measured The choice of parameters to be measured by the laboratory (Tables 15 and 16) is the result of a compromise between the need to gather as much information as possible and the cost.

This enables classification of the water on the basis of its effects on the soil/substrate, the crop and the plumbing systems; these parameters should always be measured. • Concentration of macro- and micro-elements. This tells us about the “fertilizing power” of the water and indicates the potential toxicity risks associated with the concentration of micro-elements, which depends on the pH of the water (risks increase as pH decreases). These parameters need to be measured for accurate fertilization management or if the area presents particular risks. The data provided by nearby farms with wells of a similar depth may be very useful. • Concentration of toxic substances. While generally not present in hazardous quantities in water, they can sometimes be a problem. Their use is recommended only if pollution is suspected. Heavy metals may be of geological origin, but they are sometimes the result of human activity. The meaning of the various parameters is outlined in Table 16. There are other parameters (e.g. concerning the biological hazard) that can be investigated too, but these are not generally considered for irrigation water. In summary: • Water quality is critical to successful horticulture greenhouse production. • Appropriate water quality tests should be conducted prior to selecting a greenhouse site.

Characterizing substances Calcium Magnesium Ca2+ Mg2+ Absorbed in considerable quantities by plants and not toxic, even at high concentrations; if present in considerable quantities, they react with carbonates and bicarbonates to form limescale, deposited in the pipes, nozzles and leaves.

Carbonates Bicarbonates CO32- HCO3- A progressive accumulation in the soil or substrate causes the pH to rise. In the presence of calcium or magnesium, carbonate forms insoluble compounds (limescale) which can cause plumbing problems and incrustations on leaves.

Table 17 presents the criteria for choosing the appropriate type of analysis. The general suggestions should be adapted to suit the individual situation. However, it is not possible to indicate a suitable analysis type for every situation in advance and expert advice should be sought. Interpreting a laboratory report The interpretation of an analysis certificate can appear complex to the layman, for various reasons. First, it is necessary to identify the “threshold value”, i.e. the concentration above which a substance can become harmful.

Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 191 levels of tolerance and the growing technique is also a decisive factor: for example, a given salt content can be dangerous for a greenhouse crop but not for a field crop which is periodically washed by the rain. Second, irrigation water quality must be assessed by examining the relationship between the various parameters: for example, a given salt content may be tolerated if the ions present are primarily calcium and magnesium, while it may be harmful if sodium and chlorides predominate. The threshold values in Table 18 (shown separately for greenhouse crops and open field crops) are therefore indicative and are only sufficient for the purposes of an initial assessment: expert knowledge of the farm in question is necessary for an accurate analysis. Finally, the units of measurement used to express the results may differ, making it difficult to compare different analyses or an analysis and a series of threshold values.7 ON-SITE WATER TESTING Not many farms have even a small laboratory and many do not need one.

These are portable instruments, easily available on the market at a wide range of prices, at the lower end affordable for all farms. When using these instruments it is important to follow some fundamental rules so that the readings are reliable. In summary, analytical testing of irrigation water is an essential part of any rational cultivation method. It must be repeated constantly over time to rule out composition variations which sometimes occur and may have negative effects on the crop. Periodic water pH and EC measurements performed by the farm are an important step in the right direction. Portable instruments for measuring irrigation (or fertigation) water pH and EC are affordable and user-friendly, essential for correct management of greenhouse crops. Management practices for irrigating with saline or sodic water If poor quality water is used for irrigation, one or more of the following practices may be necessary to avoid soil problems which will limit crop yields: • Provide adequate internal drainage. If barriers restrict movement of water through the root zone, water with a moderate sodium hazard (SAR > 6) or a salinity hazard (ECw > 1.5) should not be used unless drainage can be provided. 7 Table 3 gives the formulae for converting the most commonly used units of measurement and for the most important parameters.

Pardossi et al., 2004 (Tables 18a and 19) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 194 General rules for using the pH meter • Read carefully the instructions manual provided with the instrument. • The reading bulb (electrode) must remain constantly moist. It should therefore be stored in water (not distilled water) or in specific storage solution (it may be sufficient to place a moist ball of cotton wool in the bulb protection cover). • The calibration should be checked frequently by immersing the electrode in the specific known pH buffer solutions (generally pH 7.0 and 4.0). If the reading differs noticeably from the nominal value (an error of 0.1–0.2 is tolerable for field measurements), it needs to be calibrated again following the instructions in the manual. • If it takes a long time to get a stable reading, it is recommended to clean the electrode thoroughly using paper soaked in water and washing it in plenty of water (specific wash solutions are also available on the market). If the readings are still unsatisfactory after doing this, it may need replacing. • Store the instrument in a warm, dry place. General rules for using the EC meter • Read carefully the instructions manual provided with the instrument. • The EC value8 depends heavily on the water temperature (Table 19), so much so that when expressing the results it is important to indicate the reference temperature (usually 25 °C). Most of the instruments on the market – including the relatively affordable models – come with an automatic temperature compensation device. This means that the EC and the temperature values are measured and the reading at the reference temperature is provided automatically. If the instrument has this device, the readings can be used without further calculations. If it does not, the temperature needs to be taken manually and the reading needs to be converted (using Table 5) during the calibration phase. • The calibration should be checked frequently by immersing the electrode in the specific standard solutions (available at different concentrations). If the reading differs noticeably from the nominal value (an error of 0.1–0.2 mS/cm is tolerable for field measurements), it needs to be calibrated again following the instructions in the manual. • The electrode must be cleaned periodically. • Store the instrument in a warm, dry place. 8 Electric conductivity measurements do not indicate the relative amounts of any specific salt and ion. Additional specific tests typically run by outside laboratories must determine concentrations of specific ions. 9. Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 195 • Monitor salt and sodium with saline-alkaline soil tests every 1–2 years. Development of a sodium hazard usually requires time: soil tests for SAR of saturation extract or percentage of exchangeable sodium detect changes before permanent damage occurs; proper management maintains SAR and salinity values steady below danger level. Soil samples should be taken to represent the top 30 cm and the second 30 cm. Occasionally samples should be taken to a depth of 1 metre. • Add soluble calcium such as gypsum (calcium sulphate) to reduce the SAR to a safe value. Gypsum can be metered into the water at the required rate, or in some cases", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Gypsum can be metered into the water at the required rate, or in some cases it can be broadcast annually over the field. If broadcast, apply directly ahead of irrigation or incorporate thoroughly into the tillage layer to avoid crusting problems. If the soil contains free lime, elemental sulphur could be broadcast. The sulphur solubilizes the calcium from the free lime already in the soil. If gypsum is used, the leaching requirement may be increased. • Use should be restricted to drought periods to supplement below-normal rainfall or when other sources of water are inadequate. The appropriate combination of practices depends on which hazard or hazards are associated with the water to be used, and the severity of the hazards. Sometimes the risk and cost is too great to attempt using the water. Table 20 provides some help, but expert advice should be sought if the water constitutes a high or very high hazard.

Monitor with soil test at the end of each season. a To determine sodium hazard, match ECw value with appropriate column, read down to SAR or SARa value, and read sodium hazard in left-hand column (Hergert and Knudsen, 1977). b Use SARa if water is used to irrigate soils containing free calcium carbonate (lime). Soil pH will exceed 7.0. Ayers and Westcot, 1984 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 196 CORRECTING WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS Desalination Water supplies are becoming increasingly critical, meaning that in some cases saltwater has to be used for irrigation purposes. Rather than taking water from the sea, as in some greenhouse production areas (e.g. in Almería, Spain), it is possible to use wastewater from industrial processes or wells contaminated by seawater infiltrations. There are numerous desalination techniques, based on different principles: • Water evaporation (multiple effects, solar evaporation, thermocompression, multiple expansions) • Freezing (direct freezing process) • Use of salt-permeable membranes (electrodialysis) • Use of ion exchange resins (ionic exchange) • Use of semipermeable membranes (reverse osmosis) The systems used for agricultural purposes are essentially based on the last two techniques. Resin exchange equipment can be used to treat small volumes of water (water supply for fog or cooling systems, nebulizers etc.). Their use can range from demineralization of hard water to desalination of saltwater. In practice, the water is channelled through a cationic resin bed with a high cation exchange rate, regenerated with hydrochloric acid (HCl), then through an anionic resin bed with a high anion exchange rate, regenerated with soda (NaOH). After these two passages, the water has a relatively modest salt content, according to the degree at which the process was carried out. Reverse osmosis technology is used to treat large volumes of water. Although this technology arrived on the market relatively recently, it quickly established itself thanks to the advantages it offered: versatility, excellent performance and ease of use. In order to explain this process, it must be remembered that when two solutions of different concentration are placed in contact through a semipermeable membrane (permeable to the solvent and not to the solute), the water passes spontaneously from the most diluted solution to the more concentrated solution.

In order to explain this process, it must be remembered that when two solutions of different concentration are placed in contact through a semipermeable membrane (permeable to the solvent and not to the solute), the water passes spontaneously from the most diluted solution to the more concentrated solution. The pressure that needs to be exercised on a solution in contact with the pure solvent through a semipermeable membrane in order to stop the flow of solvent towards the solution is called osmotic pressure. If pressure is placed on the more concentrated solution, the solvent flow will be slowed until it comes to a stop and will then be reversed if the pressure is increased. This process, known as reverse osmosis, is used to separate the pure solvent (in this case water) from a 9. Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 197 solution. The pressure that has to be applied to achieve reverse osmosis depends on a number of different factors, including the concentration of the solution and temperature. In order to have sufficient waterflow, high operating pressures are used, as the osmotic pressure of seawater is around 22 atm. Depending on the type of membrane used, and therefore on its efficiency, it is possible to achieve various degrees of desalination, and water with a saline content suitable for industrial or agricultural purposes, or even for human consumption, can be achieved directly. The effectiveness of this very interesting water desalination process essentially depends on the quality of the selective membranes used. The principle characteristics of membranes for reverse osmosis are: • high mechanical resistance (kg/cm²); • permeability to the solvent (m³/m² per day); and • high rejection (capacity to oppose the passage of solutes, measured as a percentage of solutes initially contained in the solutions treated and still present after treatment). The useful life (in reference to operating pressures) of a desalination membrane for reverse osmosis is the time during which it preserves its permeability characteristics, making it possible to keep the waterflow constant at a given degree of purity. It is reduced as substances are deposited on the membranes and by the action of micro-organisms, for which appropriate pretreatments are required. Mass-produced systems currently available on the market are distinguished primarily by the quality of incoming water they accept, expressed in mg/litre of total dissolved salts (TDS), which vary from 1 500–2 000 mg/litre (low salinity) to 5 000 mg/litre (brackish water), and 15 000 mg/litre (seawater); and by production, which can vary from a few cubic metres to over 1 000 m³ per day. pH correction In irrigation, particularly fertigation, it is advisable to correct the pH of the water, especially with hardness > 20–30 °f (200–300 mg/litre of calcium carbonate; 1 °f corresponds to 10 mg/litre). This operation reduces incrustation and the subsequent damage to the irrigation systems themselves, and keeps the pH of the substrate within the values required for normal physiological activity of the roots (growth, absorption of water and minerals) and for adequate availability of nutrients. Acidification In conditions typical of Mediterranean greenhouse areas, subterranean irrigation water is generally characterized by high alkalinity, linked to the relatively high GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 198 (oversaturation) concentration (equivalent concentration) of the carbonate ion (CO32-) and, even more so, bicarbonate ion (HCO3 -), considering that the former is only present in significant concentrations for pH of over 8.0.

This is a completely acceptable approximation within the irrigation water pH range. We can therefore calculate the pH as for a buffer solution: Eq. 2 As mentioned earlier, the irrigation water is very rich in bicarbonates and carbonates. This moves the chemical equilibrium (Equation 1) to the left and leads to the formation of carbon dioxide, which tends to disperse into the air, consequently subtracting H+ from the solution and increasing the pH. This explains the pH variations often encountered when a water sample is left in contact with the air for some time, as well as the absence of a close relationship between the alkalinity of the water and its pH.9 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 + 𝐻𝐻2𝐶𝐶↔𝐻𝐻2𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶3 ↔𝐻𝐻𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶3−+ 𝐻𝐻+ ↔𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶32−+ 2𝐻𝐻+ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 1 = ([𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂3−]𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥[𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻+]) [𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻2𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂3] = 4.45 • 10−7 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾2 = ([𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂32−]𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥[𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻+]) [𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂3−] = 4.7 • 10−11 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝= 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 1 + 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙([𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂3−]/[𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝2𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂3]) 9 The equivalent concentration of one ion in a solution is calculated on the basis of the molar concentration divided by its valence (1 for HCO3-, 2 for CO32-). 9. Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 199 The addition of acid to the water leads to the progressive transformation of carbonates and bicarbonates into carbonic acid, and then into carbon dioxide. The amount of acid needed to reach a certain pH therefore depends on the initial carbonate and bicarbonate concentration, or rather the alkalinity. The acidification reaction is as follows: Note that the number of acid equivalents [HA], of bicarbonates subtracted from the solution and of carbonic acid formed are equal, therefore: Eq. 3 Eq. 4 We can now take Equation 3; replacing Equations 4 and 2 we have: by extracting [HA] we obtain the concentration of acid needed to obtain the desired pH on the basis of the bicarbonate concentration: Eq. 5 Equation 5 shows that an acid (H+) concentration equivalent to about 70 percent of the bicarbonate concentration in the water gives a pH of 6.0. On the basis of the calculated concentration [HA] and of the characteristics (concentration, density, equivalent weight) of the product to be used, the quantity of acid is calculated using the most common units of measurement in the field: where: Q is the quantity of acid (ml/litre or litre/m3) necessary to obtain the desired pH EW the equivalent weight of the acid D the density (kg/litre) of the acid AC its concentration (% w/w) Chloridric, nitric, phosphoric (considered monoprotic) and sulphuric acid can all be used with great care (add the acid to the water, never the other way round).

Irrigation water quality for greenhouse horticulture 201 Many acidification devices inject acid into a tank rather than onto a pipe: contact with the air facilitates the formation of carbonic acid, and carbon dioxide is therefore exchanged with the atmosphere. This allows more accurate regulation of the final pH. Addition of bicarbonates In the case of surface water, rainwater or desalinated water, it may be necessary to add small concentrations (approx. 100–150 mg/litre) of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), in order to boost the buffer power (that is to say the capacity to keep the pH relatively constant) of the irrigation or fertigation water, which is determined by the carbonic acid/bicarbonate system. Bicarbonate addition is a simple process which makes it possible to avoid sudden marked drops in the pH (even to levels below 4.0), which could be caused by an imprecise dose of acid or physiological acidification of the roots. Filtration There are three main types of filter on the market, useful for suspended solid matter: • Mesh filters. The water is filtered through a stainless steel and/or nylon mesh with a gauge that varies in size depending on the particles to be filtered. This technology generally uses filters with 70–200 mesh (number of holes/inch), equivalent to a hole diameter of 210–75 mm. Suitable for water free from organic matter, but containing fine and very fine sand. Filters can be cleaned manually or automatically by inverting the flow. • Vortex or hydrocyclone desanders. The water is forced into a vortex. The centrifugal force separates matter with a higher specific weight (earth and sand) which accumulates at the bottom of the filter. Suitable for water rich in sand and large particles, but not for organic matter lighter than water. Must be used in combination with mesh filters. • Sand or grit filters. The filter element consists of layers of sand and/or gravel in large containers. It is combined with mesh filters and used to eliminate organic matter, but requires frequent and constant cleaning.

Optimal alkalinity range of 0.75–2.6 meq/litre, being generally smaller when plants are younger. • Salinity directly affects plant capability to absorb water and photosynthesize. Optimal water present EC < 0.75 mS/cm (or dS/m). Plant growth is generally not affected up to 2.0 mS/cm (or dS/m), although different responses among species and cultivars may be found. Yield decreases are generally experienced when water EC is above 2.0 mS/cm (or dS/m). Moreover, also the composition of salts should be assessed, since some elements may present specific toxicity in plants. • Low quality waters may be corrected through desalination, pH correction, acidification, addition of bicarbonates and filtration.

Answers are first required to basic questions: What is soil fertility and what role do plant nutrients play in vegetable production? What are typical amounts and forms of plant nutrients in soils? What nutrient forms do crops take up? What are the input and output of plant nutrients to and from soils? What factors affect conversion between forms? What variations in plant nutrient availability occur between soils? To optimize plant nutrition, it is necessary to ask: Which plant processes are particularly sensitive to plant nutrients? How do nutrients move within the plant? How do plant nutrients affect growth, yield and quality of the produce? What will be the crop’s nutrient requirement throughout the growing season? What will be the total requirement of the crop for nutrients? What is the expected trend of nutrient concentration in the different organs during the growing season? Decision-making in fertilization strategy requires answers to other specific questions: When is soil and plant nutrient status considered sufficient? What are the critical values or ranges for plant nutrients? What type of soil and plant analyses are best for making fertilizer recommendations? What will be the supply of nutrients from the soil? What are the natural and man-supplied sources of plant nutrients? Which principles of plant nutrient management does the grower need to understand and apply to ensure unrestricted crop growth, product quality and minimum environmental pollution? How effective will any application of manure and fertilizer be and, therefore, how much should be applied? GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 206 Plant nutrition and fertilization practices are important components of the GAP protocols. To contribute to successful application of GAP, this chapter gives a short overview of soil fertility, nutrient functions in plant metabolism, plant nutrient requirements, fertilization management, nutrient availability in the root zone and the impact of nutrient imbalances on plant growth and yield. SOIL FERTILITY Soil fertility is a complex feature and is crucial to the productivity of agricultural soils.

A definition of soil fertility inclusive of long-term sustainability must consider the complex interaction between the biological, chemical and physical properties which affect directly or indirectly nutrient dynamics and availability. In greenhouses, the management of soil fertility is of utmost importance for optimizing crop nutrition on both a short-term and a long-term basis to achieve sustainable crop production. It is related to the greenhouse climate and the complex interaction involving the many factors contributing to the biological, chemical and physical properties of the soil: • Biological factors can be both beneficial (microbial population, mycorrhizal fungi, Rhizobium bacteria) and harmful (soil-borne pathogens). • Physical properties of importance for greenhouse production are soil texture and structure (Box 1), the soil volume that can be explored by the roots, and its water-holding capacity. • Chemical factors contributing to soil fertility include nutrient status and soil organic matter (Box 2), soil pH (Box 3) and cation exchange capacity (Box 4). Many of soil’s biological, chemical and physical properties change comparatively slowly, but under greenhouse conditions (especially in Mediterranean areas) changes occur more rapidly due to the climatic conditions (e.g. high temperatures) and the high agronomic inputs (e.g. water, fertilizers) needed to sustain the intensive cultivation of the soils. Like all soils, greenhouse soils contain natural reserves of plant nutrients, but only a small proportion are readily available for crops (nutrients in the soil solution or adsorbed onto the exchange complex). Less available forms (organic matter or insoluble minerals) must be solubilized or mineralized to be taken up 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 207 by the crops. These processes are usually slow, but are accelerated by the high temperatures found in greenhouses. The nutrients dissolved in the soil’s water are mainly nitrate, magnesium, potassium and sulphates. The quantity of these nutrients is normally low and not sufficient for greenhouse crops which have high nutrient requirements (Sonneveld and Voogt, 2009). Soil solution used in greenhouses differs greatly from that used for crops in the open air, mainly because of the higher application of fertilizers and the greater extraction of nutrients by plants. The nutrients adsorbed in the exchange complex (mainly calcium, magnesium and potassium) are potentially good indicators of the total amount of nutrients in the soil. In order to be available for the crops, they must be desorbed and enter the BOX 1 Soil texture and structure Soil texture is the tool used to describe the grains and mineral particle sizes in a soil. Particles are grouped according to their size into three soil separates: 1. sand separates with a diameter of 0.05–2 mm 2. silt separates with a diameter of 0.002–0.05 mm 3. clay separates with a diameter of < 0.002 mm Soil texture classification is based on the fractions of soil separates present in a soil and twelve major soil texture classifications are defined by the USDA: 1. sand 2. loamy sand 3. silt 4. sandy loam 5. loam 6. silt loam 7. sandy clay loam 8. clay loam 9. silty clay loam 10. sandy clay 11. silty clay 12. clay Soil structure is determined by how individual soil grains clump or bind together and aggregate, and describes the arrangement of soil pores between them. Soil structure has a major influence on water and air movement and availability, biological activity and root growth and crop performance. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 208 soil solution. Those nutrients which are less available are in the form of organic or mineral-insoluble material; they move with the help of soil micro-organisms. It is very important to analyse the soil at the beginning of the growing period (Plate 1) to understand the nutrient content now and in the future. It is thus possible to plan well the fertilization strategy, and nutrient deficiencies can be avoided.

It can be divided into three general pools: 1. living biomass of micro-organisms 2. well-decomposed organic matter 3. highly stable organic material Surface crop residues are generally not included as part of soil organic matter. When organic material is incorporated into the soil, some components (e.g. proteins) degrade quickly (in a period of weeks to months), while others (e.g. lignins) decay very slowly. This rather stable organic material is called humus and roughly corresponds to SOM. SOM has a key role in both plant nutrition (release of nutrients, energy supply for soil micro-organisms, formation of the nutrient exchange complex) and soil structure (improvement of porosity and soil aeration, increase of water-holding capacity in sandy soils, limiting of compaction and erosion of heavy soils). SOM is generally estimated indirectly as the result of the concentration of organic carbon times 1.724. a For soil texture classification, see Box 1.

Soil fertility and plant nutrition 209 BOX 3 Soil pH Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity in soils. It ranges from 0 to 14: 0 most acidic, 14 highly basic, 7 neutral. Soil pH is considered a master variable in soils as it controls many chemical processes. It specifically affects plant nutrient availability by controlling the chemical forms of the nutrient. The optimum pH for most plants is 6–7.5, however, many plants have adapted to thrive at pH outside this range. Soil reaction affects also microbial activity. BOX 4 Cation exchange capacity (CEC) CEC expresses the maximum quantity of total cations a soil can hold, at a given pH value, for exchanging with the soil solution. CEC is a measure of fertility, nutrient retention capacity and the capacity to protect groundwater from cation contamination.

Therefore, unlike animals, plants need only inorganic compounds to cover their nutritional needs. A total of 16 inorganic elements are essential for plant growth and development (Table 1). More than half of these elements (in particular: carbon C, hydrogen H, oxygen O, nitrogen N, phosphorus P, potassium K, sulphur S, calcium Ca and magnesium Mg) are needed in relatively large quantities and are, therefore, known as “macronutrients” (or major nutrients). Other elements (in particular: iron Fe, manganese Mn, zinc Zn, copper Cu, boron B, molybdenum Mo and chlorine Cl) are also indispensable for plant growth, but they are needed in much smaller quantities and are, therefore, termed “micronutrients” (or trace elements). Of the nine plant macronutrients, C is taken up from the air as CO2 through the leaf stomata and fixed into organic compounds via photosynthesis, while H and O are constituents of the water. In most cases, sufficient quantities of Ca, Mg and S (in the form of sulphates) are available in the soil and irrigation water and, therefore, these macronutrients are not included in standard crop fertilization schemes. Thus, in most cases, only three macronutrients – N, P and K – need to be supplied by growers to the crops via fertilization.

In soil-grown greenhouse crops, some of the nutrient requirement is applied as a base-dressing. This is particularly the case with P, which is somewhat immobile in the soil. In contrast, N, which is highly soluble in water in the form of nitrate and ammonium salts, is supplied to the crop after planting. In many greenhouses, water-soluble fertilizers are applied to the crop after planting through the irrigation system (fertigation).

Soil fertility and plant nutrition 211 on labour and fertilizers and improve plant mineral uptake. As a result, water-use efficiency can increase considerably if the water and nutrient doses are correct. In many parts of the world, including most Mediterranean countries, many greenhouse growers still determine fertilizer application rates by a “rule of thumb”. In most cases, this practice results in excessive application rates for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. In some cases, excessive application of one or more nutrients is accompanied by inadequate supply of other nutrients, thereby exacerbating the incidence of single-nutrient toxicities or deficiencies, or even resulting in multinutritional disorders. To prevent such problems, balanced fertilization schemes based on knowledge of plant nutrient requirements and soil nutrient reserves, which should be determined by chemical soil analysis, are needed. Optimal fertilizer application rates for each particular nutrient can thus be estimated by deducting the soil reserves from the total plant requirements. NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK Traditional management of nutrients in greenhouse production is based on the assumption that plant growth is not limited by water and nutrient uptake. In greenhouses, if fertilization is not well managed in soil-grown crops (e.g. excessive amounts of fertilizer, fertilizers distributed only at planting without splitting nitrogen rate throughout the growing season), a water surplus is often necessary to avoid soil salinization and to keep soil moisture high. Additional fertilization is then necessary to compensate for nutrient losses caused by leaching (Kläring, 2001). The main factors causing N-NO3 leaching in greenhouse crops in Almería (Spain) are manure and excessive irrigation during the first weeks after planting (Thompson et al., 2007). In Mediterranean countries, soilless cultivation has been developed mainly as open system, where excess nutrient solution is required to drain the substrate. In this kind of system, the irrigation strategy provides a quantity of nutrient solution that is 30 to 50 percent in excess of the crop requirements in order to avoid salt buildup near the root zone (Ehret et al., 2001). Nitrogen contained in nutrient solution discharges (leachates) from soilless horticulture is a major contributor to groundwater pollution and eutrophication in greenhouse crops (Antón, 2004; TABLE 2 Ranges of nutrient concentrations in fertigation solutions supplied in greenhouse crops (mg litre-1) Nitrogen (N) 50–200 Iron (Fe) a 1.0–4.0 Phosphorus (P) a 10–50 Manganese (Mn) a 0.5–2.0 Sulphur (S) – Zinc (Zn) a 0.2–0.5 Potassium (K) 100–250 Copper (Cu) a 0.02–0.06 Calcium (Ca) a 50–150 Boron (B) a 0.2–0.5 Magnesium (Mg) a 20–50 Molybdenum (Mo) a 0.02–0.10 a Routinely not included in the fertigation scheme unless inadequate availability is indicated by soil analysis.

In north European countries, annual N losses from open soilless cultivation approach 1 tonne ha-1 (Duchein et al., 1995). Closed or recirculating soilless hydroponic systems (Plate 2) give the lowest environmental impacts (Antón, 2004): while they can significantly reduce fertilizer runoff, they cannot eliminate it, as the exhausted nutrient solution has to be ultimately collected and treated at the end of the crop cycle. Intermediate situations, for example cascade crops, reduce the consumption of water and fertilizers and the environmental impact in certain categories (e.g. eutrophication and climate change) (Muñoz et al., 2008b). However, closed systems involve greater installation and running costs, need a high degree of automation and technical skill, and their economic viability is a question of debate in southern Europe (De Pascale and Maggio, 2005; Massa et al., 2010). Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an objective and transparent methodology to quantify and assess a product’s environmental burden (Audsley, 1997). For greenhouse crops, a reduction in fertilizer input can significantly reduce the environmental impact from a Mediterranean greenhouse in terms of air acidification, depletion of abiotic resources, eutrophication, greenhouse effect and photochemical oxidant formation (Antón et al., 2005; Muñoz et al., 2008a). Diminishing their use in greenhouse production decreases the depletion of natural gas, for example, in the production of KNO3, K2SO4 and (NH4)2PO4. A reduction in the use of nitrogen fertilizers can reduce the emission of methane during their production, and can significantly decrease photo-oxidant formation. Nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases produce a significant impact in the greenhouse effect category, as they are released mainly during the production of fertilizers such as KNO3, (NH4)2PO4 and NH4NO3. NITROGEN Nitrogen (N) is essential for all life processes in plants. It is a structural component of all proteins including enzymes, which are involved in all chemical reactions that together constitute the processes of growth and development. Furthermore, N is an important component of the nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) and is a central part of chlorophyll. It is present in plant alkaloids, in some B complex vitamins, including thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5) and Plate 2 Tomato crop with soilless crop systems where leachate is collected and recirculated 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 213 folic acid (B9), and in many other substances (in the vegetation of field crops N accounts for approximately 2–4 percent of the dry matter weight). Nitrogen stimulates vegetative growth and ensures high rates of flower formation, fruit-set and assimilation inflow into developing fruits. Insufficient N supply – manifested in uniformly chlorotic leaves – severely restricts plant growth and yield. In vegetable crops, the yield response to N is dramatic and farmers tend to apply N fertilizers to maximize yields, rather than risk underfertilizing and suffering revenue losses. Nitrogen sources Soil minerals do not contain N, or its content is negligible. Hence, unlike other plant nutrients, N does not become available to the plant via the weathering of inorganic soil particles. Atmosphere The earth's atmosphere is the major reservoir for N (air is 78 percent N2 gas) and is the ultimate source of N. Atmospheric N becomes available to the plant through fixation. It can be fixed by specific bacteria, by reaction with oxygen at high temperatures (during electrical storms, in combustion processes and through oxidation by sunlight), and in fertilizer production. Large amounts of atmospheric N can be used by legumes through their symbiotic association with Rhizobium bacteria, which inhabit the roots of the plants. These bacteria have the capacity to incorporate N2 from the air and convert it to a form available to the plant – a process known as biological N fixation. Residue of any legume crop left after harvest adds N to the soil system; when plant material decomposes, N is released. Atmospheric N oxidized by lightning and in combustion processes (atmospheric fixation) generally returns to the soil surface, either with rain or snow, or in a dry form (wet and dry atmospheric deposition). The latter can account for twice as much N as the former.

The latter can account for twice as much N as the former. In most European countries, the annual rate of atmospheric deposition of N is extremely variable and can reach 40 kg ha-1 or more (Laegreid et al., 1999). However, in a greenhouse, where rainfall does not occur and air changes are quite slow, atmospheric deposition accounts for an almost insignificant proportion of the N in the soil. In greenhouse systems, the most important source of N is the irrigation water, an N input which every grower should take into account when planning N fertilization. Almost all commercial N fertilizers are derived from atmospheric N. They originate from ammonia (NH3), which, in turn, is made by combining atmospheric N and hydrogen. The hydrogen mostly comes from the reaction between water and methane (Box 5). GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 214 Soil organic matter Soil organic matter (SOM) is also a major source of N (over 90 percent of soil N is associated with SOM). SOM in the top 25 cm of soil represents a stock of about 1 700– 1 800 kg N ha-1, of which only 1–3 percent is decomposed on an annual basis in open air crops (Vos and MacKerron, 2000). The net result is that a small amount of the SOM is mineralized each year during periods when soil temperature and water content favour microbe and soil animal activity. The higher the temperature, the more quickly mineralization occurs, and in greenhouses (with frequent watering and high temperatures), SOM mineralization accelerates, increasing N availability but causing more rapid depletion of soil organic N. The mineralization rate can also be increased by tillage; shallow and light tillage is preferred to preserve the SOM. Returning crop residues to the soil or introducing other organic sources such as animal manures or compost may replenish the SOM. Although crop residues represent a significant potential source of N (Scharpf, 1991), in greenhouse cropping systems the aerial part of most crops is rarely incorporated into the soil, but is removed to avoid the risk of spreading diseases. Only root residues contribute to the soil N; the amount of N can nevertheless be relatively high if legumes have been grown. Animal manure Animal manures are another potentially important source of N. The quantity of N supplied by manure varies with type of livestock (species, age and diet), handling (e.g. bedding materials), application rate and method of application. As a general indication, cattle manure may contain 5–18 kg N/tonne. About half of this nitrogen is converted relatively quickly (some months) to forms available to plants. Lesser amounts are gradually converted over a longer period. Decay occurs more rapidly in greenhouses than in the open field as a consequence of the higher BOX 5 How N fertilizers are obtained The reaction to obtain N fertilizer is: Ammonia may be used as a fertilizer (anhydrous ammonia), or as a starting point in the manufacture of other nitrogen fertilizers. It can be combined with carbon dioxide to form urea [CO(NH2)2]. Oxidation of ammonia produces nitric acid (HNO3). This combines with ammonia to give ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3).

Since the N form and content of manures varies widely, analysis of the manure is recommended to improve N management. Compost Compost generally supplies proportionately less mineral N than crop residues and manures. During the composting process, easily degraded fresh material breaks down. Some of the N is volatilized, and the organic matter that remains is relatively resistant to mineralization. Nevertheless, applying compost year after year indirectly enhances the supply of organic nitrogen by increasing the soil’s humus content. Nitrogen transformations and utilization by plant Once N enters the soil, various transformations condition its availability to plants and influence the potential losses to the environment.

Plants take up N either as NO3- or as NH4+. Usually NO3- dominates over NH4+ in soils, and most crops take up more NO3- than NH4+. Together they are known as soil mineral N. Urea nitrogen [CO(NH2)2] may also be taken up by plants to some extent and at certain growing stages (Tan et al., 2000). However, most of the urea supplied to soil as fertilizer is first converted into NH4+ and then taken up by plants either in that form, or as NO3- after nitrification. Nitrogen bound in organic compounds must first be first converted into NO3- or NH4+ through mineralization before being taken up by plants. Not only the roots, but also the plant leaves have the capacity to absorb N; spraying foliage is therefore another method of N application. Organic material in the soil, including crop residues, manures and composts, is digested by a succession of soil animals and micro-organisms which gradually break down large molecules to smaller molecules and, finally, to carbon dioxide, water and minerals. Mineralization refers to the process of breakdown of organic matter in the soil, and it results in the release of ammonium (NH4+). The mineralization rate depends on soil moisture conditions, soil acidity, temperature and microbial activity. Bacterial growth itself is directly related to soil temperature and water content; therefore, the rate of mineralization and NH4+ formation increases in greenhouses as the temperature is high. On the other hand, soil disinfection (frequently carried out in greenhouses) to reduce the microbe population slows down the mineralization processes. Soil micro-organisms need N to prosper and multiply. As a consequence, when the organic matter incorporated in the soil is poor in N, soil organisms need to absorb NH4+ from the soil – or, to a lesser extent, nitrate (NO3-) – in order to be able to utilize the organic material. This conversion of soluble forms of N to organic forms is called N immobilization. These forms are temporarily tied up in microbial tissue, to be mineralized when the organisms die and are themselves subjected to degradation. Whether or not immobilization of N takes place depends on the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) of the organic material. If the C:N ratio GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 216 exceeds 20 (e.g. cereal straw), nitrogen is immobilized during degradation. When the C:N ratio is lower than 20 (e.g. vegetable and legume residues), degradation of the material results directly in mineralization of N. In well-drained soil, NH4+ is transformed to NO3- by bacteria. This process is fairly rapid and is called nitrification. These bacteria are relatively inactive at lower soil temperatures and therefore one will find larger NH4+/NO3- ratios in winter and early spring than in summer, and in the open field than in the greenhouse. Once applied, fertilizer N is subject to the same transformations as other sources of N; for example, urea [CO(NH2)2] readily hydrolyses to produce NH4+, and is then converted into NO3- through nitrification. NH4+and NO3- are the ultimate forms of N taken up by plants from the soil solution and through their roots. Nitrogen losses Nitrogen may be lost from the soil-plant system via various routes, including volatilization, denitrification and leaching. In the open field, N may also be lost through soil erosion (mainly NH4+), but in the greenhouse this loss mechanism is practically null. Volatilization Volatilization is the process whereby soil N forms are converted to ammonia (NH3) gas. If the NH3 is formed at the soil surface, N may be lost to the atmosphere. This loss mechanism is limited to surface-applied N sources, and is commonly associated with surface-applied urea. Nevertheless, other ammonium fertilizers (e.g. ammonium sulphate) and manures may undergo this process. Loss of N from volatilization dramatically increases when soil pH is high (≥ 7), air temperature high and soil surface moist, and when there is a lot of residue on the soil. In such conditions, 10–25 percent of broadcast urea can be lost through volatilization (Laegreid et al., 1999).

In such conditions, 10–25 percent of broadcast urea can be lost through volatilization (Laegreid et al., 1999). Considering the climate and soil conditions generally found in greenhouses, surface spreading of fertilizers is not recommended. Volatilization losses are virtually eliminated if the N fertilizer is lightly incorporated into the soil. Denitrification Denitrification occurs when soils are nearly water-saturated: roots and soil organisms consume oxygen quickly, and anaerobiosis occurs. In anaerobic conditions, most soil organisms (including roots) cease activity; but some micro- organisms are specifically adapted to such conditions; some have the capacity to extract oxygen from soil NO3-. During this process, N2 gas is formed and escapes to the atmosphere. Soil should not be waterlogged for denitrification; if the top layer of soil is unsaturated and the deeper layer saturated (e.g. depth of 15–30 cm, where much of 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 217 the N is present), considerable N losses can occur (Revsbech and Sorensen, 1990). Denitrification requires a sufficient amount of organic matter to provide energy for bacteria. The process proceeds rapidly when soils are warm and become saturated for 2 or 3 days. In addition to N2 gas, traces of nitrous oxide (N2O) are formed. This is a cause for environmental concern, because it is a persistent and potent greenhouse gas and does not return to the soil surface as part of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. In greenhouses, when irrigation is managed correctly and soil saturation is avoided, N losses through denitrification are negligible; on the other hand, under inappropriate conditions, losses can be significant. Leaching Volatilization and denitrification are processes promoted by biological transformations; loss of NO3- by leaching is a physical event. Leaching is the process whereby NO3- moves downwards in the soil profile with soil water. Leaching of NO3- is possible because NO3- is an anion (negatively charged ion) and is repelled by negatively charged surfaces of clay minerals and SOM. This keeps NO3- in the soil solution and it moves in whatever direction the soil water moves. In contrast, NH4+ is a cation (positively charged ion) and it is attracted and held by negatively charged soil particles; therefore, NH4+ does not move a lot in the soil. It is evident that soils have a higher binding capacity for cations than anions, but some anion-binding capacity does exist. However, other anions (e.g. phosphate and sulphate) are bound in preference to NO3-. Leaching takes place when water inputs exceed the water used by the crop. In such conditions, water drains in the soil profile, dragging NO3- with it below the root zone, where it may enter either ground- or surface water. Leaching represents both a loss of N from the system and an environmental concern. Nitrate-rich surface water exerts ecological effects in non-agricultural ecosystems (e.g. eutrophication), while nitrate-rich groundwater cannot readily be used to produce drinking water (Council of European Communities, 1991). Sandy soils have a higher potential to leach NO3- than fine-textured soils, as they have a lower water-holding capacity and the water moves more easily through them. A deep and extensive root system enables crops to take up N efficiently and minimizes the risk of leaching. The extent of root development and the amount of N needed to produce a satisfactory yield depends on the crop. Many vegetables have shallow roots and a high N demand, and consequently nitrate leaching from vegetable production can be substantial.

Phosphorus sources Phosphorus is found naturally in water and soils, as well as in all living organisms. In soils, many P compounds exist, in both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic P ranges from 50 to 75 percent of total soil P and is usually associated with aluminium (Al), iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) compounds of varying solubility and availability to plants. Organic P compounds range from readily available plant residues and micro-organisms within the soil to stable compounds that have become part of soil organic matter. In cultivated soils, P is present in abundance (1 100 kg/ha), but most of it is not available to plants (15 percent of total soil P is in available form). In practical terms, P in soils can exist in three “pools”: solution, active and fixed P. Solution P pool The solution P pool is very small and usually in orthophosphate form (H2PO4-1 or HPO4-2), but small amounts of organic P may exist as well. Plants only take up P in orthophosphate form via an active energy-requiring process. The solution P pool is important because it is the pool from which plants take up P. A growing crop quickly depletes the P in the soluble P pool if the pool is not continuously replenished. Active P pool The active P pool is P in the solid phase, and it is relatively easily released to the soil solution. As plants take up phosphate, the concentration of phosphate in the solution decreases and some phosphate from the active P pool is released. Because the solution P pool is very small, the active P pool is the main source of available P for crops. The ability of the active P pool to replenish the soil solution P pool in a soil is what makes a soil fertile in terms of phosphate. The active P pool contains the following: 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 219 • inorganic phosphate adsorbed to particles in the soil; • phosphate that reacted with elements such as calcium or aluminium to form soluble solids; and • organic P that is easily mineralized. Soil particles can act as a source or a sink of phosphate to the surrounding water, depending on conditions: the amount of phosphate adsorbed by soil increases as the amount of phosphate in solution increases and vice versa. Fixed P pool The fixed P pool of phosphate contains inorganic phosphate compounds that are very insoluble and organic compounds that are resistant to mineralization by micro-organisms in the soil. Phosphate in this pool may remain in soils for years without being made available to plants and may have very little impact on fertility. The inorganic phosphate compounds in this fixed P pool are more crystalline in their structure and less soluble than compounds in the active P pool. Phosphorus transformations and utilization by plant Some slow conversion between the fixed P pool and the active P pool occurs in soils either by plant roots or by soil micro-organisms through secretion of organic acids (e.g. lactic, acetic, formic, fumaric and succinic acids) (Richardson and Simpson, 2011). Soil micro-organisms may also release soluble inorganic phosphate into the soil via decomposition of phosphate-rich organic compounds (mineralization). Solubilization of phosphate by plant roots and soil micro- organisms is substantially influenced by various soil factors, including pH, moisture and aeration. Many phosphate-solubilizing micro-organisms are found in close proximity to the root surfaces and can enhance phosphate assimilation by higher plants. Mineralization occurs in most soils (more in acidic to neutral soils with high organic P content) and is favoured by high temperatures, but it is usually too slow to provide enough P for crop growth.

Mineralization occurs in most soils (more in acidic to neutral soils with high organic P content) and is favoured by high temperatures, but it is usually too slow to provide enough P for crop growth. Certain micro-organisms, especially bacteria, assimilate soluble phosphate and are useful for cell synthesis (P immobilization) (Richardson and Simpson, 2011). Temporarily tied up in microbial tissue, they are eventually mineralized when the organisms die and are subject to degradation. As phosphate ions enter soil solution, they generally react by adsorbing to soil particles or by combining with elements in the soil, such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe), and forming compounds that are solids and precipitate (P fixation). The mechanisms for P fixation are complex and involve a variety of compounds. In alkaline soils (pH > 7.3), Ca is the dominant cation (positive ion) that reacts with phosphate and decreases its solubility and availability. In acidic soils, Al and GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 220 Fe are the dominant ions that react with phosphate. Aluminium is most active at a pH of 5.0–5.5. Iron is especially active below pH 4.0 where phosphate is strongly fixed. Of the three processes, P is relatively more available to crops when it is fixed by Ca; P fixation is, therefore, of less concern in alkaline than in acid soils. Maintaining soil pH at 6–7 generally results in the most efficient use of phosphate. Soils in warmer climates (i.e. in greenhouses) are generally much greater fixers of P than soils in more temperate regions. Phosphorus losses Phosphorus is a somewhat unique pollutant: it is an essential element, has low solubility, and is not toxic itself, but may have detrimental effects on water quality at quite low concentrations. Several chemical properties of soil P have important implications for the potential loss of P to ground- and surface water. Most soils have a good capacity to retain P. Adsorbing to soil particles or P fixing occurs rapidly and, therefore, phosphate tends to move through the soil very little, usually just a few centimetres in any single season. As a result of rapid adsorption and fixation, phosphate does not leach – or very little over a long period of time – and is not a potential hazard with regard to contamination of groundwater supplies. However, increasing the phosphate in soils results in increased levels of phosphate in soil solutions. This will generally result in small but potentially significant increases in the amount of phosphate in water passing over or through soils. Movement is slow but may be increased by rainfall or irrigation water flowing through the soil. POTASSIUM Potassium (K) has many important regulatory roles in plant development: synthesis of lignin and cellulose, used for formation of cellular structural components; regulation of photosynthesis; and production of plant sugars, used for various plant metabolic purposes. It controls water loss from plants and is involved in overall plant health; it contributes as principal cation to cell turgor and electrochemical compensation of organic anions in the plant cells. K also participates as cofactor or stimulating agent in more than 50 enzymatic systems. Therefore, both the K requirements of plants and the K concentrations in plant tissues are very high. Given the high K requirements of plants, adequate application of K is a prerequisite for high yield and quality in greenhouse crops. Potassium is highly mobile through the phloem; deficiency symptoms therefore appear in older leaves and severe K deficiency causes necrosis of the old leaves. An inadequate supply of K may considerably degrade fruit flavour and results in fruit ripening disorders, while optimum K availability improves fruit colour.

An adequate supply of K enhances fruit firmness and consequently shelf-life. On the other hand, excesses of K should be avoided to prevent antagonistic restrictions in Ca and Mg uptake. Potassium sources, utilization by plant and losses Potassium is a common element in nature, constituting about 2.3 percent of the earth’s crust. Clay minerals are soil’s main source of K, but much is present as part of insoluble mineral particles and inaccessible to plants. Plants use only exchangeable potassium located on the surface of soil particles or potassium dissolved in the soil water, often amounting to less than 100 mg K kg-1 soil. There are three forms of K in the soil: • Unavailable K is contained within the crystalline structure of micas, feldspars and clay minerals. Plants cannot use K in these insoluble forms. Over long periods, these minerals weather or break down releasing K as available K ion (K+). This process is far too slow to supply the K needs of greenhouse crops. • Slowly available K or fixed K is trapped between the layers of certain kinds of clay minerals; plants cannot use much of this K in a single growing season. However, the supply of fixed K largely determines the soil’s ability to supply K over extended periods of time. • Readily available K or exchangeable K is dissolved in soil water or held on the surface of clay particles. As plants take up K+ from the soil solution and the concentration of K in the soil solution drops, it is restocked from the exchangeable fraction adsorbed on mineral surfaces and the equilibrium is re-established. Potassium is absorbed readily and in large quantities by an active uptake process. Once in the plant, K is very mobile and is transported to young tissues rapidly. Deficiency symptoms appear first on lower leaves as a marginal flecking or mottling. Prolonged deficiency results in necrosis along the leaf margins and plants can become slightly wilted. Deficient plant leaves usually contain less than 1.5 percent K. Since clay and organic matter particles hold potassium ions in an exchangeable or available form, potassium does not leach from silty or clayey soils. Some leaching may take place in very sandy soils because sandy soils do not contain enough clay to hold the potassium. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 222 SULPHUR, CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM • Sulphur (S) is a structural element in plant tissues: a constituent of two essential amino acids (cysteine and methionine) and many other compounds, including thiamine, coenzyme A, lipoic acid and biotin. • Calcium (Ca) is a constituent of cell walls and cell membranes. Ca contributes to the hydrolysis of ATP and phospholipids, acting as cofactor in some enzymatic systems. It is a countercation for inorganic and organic anions in the vacuole, and the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is an obligate intracellular messenger and coordinates responses to numerous developmental cues and environmental challenges. • Magnesium (Mg) is the building block of chlorophyll and is both an enzyme activator and a constituent of many enzymes. It plays a role in the following processes: sugar synthesis; starch translocation; plant oil and fat formation; nutrient uptake control; nitrogen fixation in legumes. Magnesium is also important for energy transfer, since it is involved in many phosphorylation reactions. In well-managed, fertile greenhouse soils with normal pH levels, the Ca, Mg and S requirements of greenhouse crops are covered by the soil reserves. In exceptional cases, the availability of Mg and, less frequently, that of Ca in the soil may also be insufficient, depending on soil properties, composition of applied irrigation water and average year precipitation. In particular, levels of available Ca are likely to be insufficient only in acidic, sandy or organic soils.

Sulphur, calcium and magnesium sources, utilization by plant and losses Sulphur Most soil sources of S are found in organic matter and are therefore concentrated in the topsoil or plough layer. Elemental S and other forms as found in soil organic matter and some fertilizers, are not available to crops. They must be converted to the sulphate (SO42-) form to become available to the crop. This conversion is performed by soil micro-organisms and therefore requires soil conditions that are warm, moist and well drained to proceed rapidly. The sulphate form of S is an anion (negative charge) and is, therefore, leachable. Sulphur is absorbed mainly as SO42-. It is not very mobile in the plant, and deficiency therefore generally begins in the new growth. Deficiency symptoms consist of a general yellowing of the upper leaves. Plant leaves usually contain between 0.2 and 0.5 percent S on a dry-weight basis – a range similar to that for P. Plants can generally tolerate quite high levels of S in the growing media; this is one of the reasons for which sulphur-containing materials are widely used to supply nutrients such as Mg and micronutrients, and S deficiency is thus not very common in greenhouse vegetable crops. 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 223 Calcium Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the earth's crust and is widely found in nature. Very severe Ca deficiency occurs in crops when soil tests reveal exchangeable Ca to be less than 0.5 meq/100 g. Calcium, unlike most elements, is absorbed and transported by a passive mechanism. The transpiration process of the plants is a major factor in the uptake of Ca. Once in the plant, calcium moves towards areas of high transpiration, such as the rapidly expanding leaves. Most of the uptake of Ca occurs in a region just behind the root tip – important for greenhouse vegetable culture, because growers must keep healthy root systems with plenty of actively growing root tips. Root diseases will severely limit calcium uptake in the plant. Calcium moves very slowly in the plant; therefore, deficiency symptoms appear first on new growth. Ca deficiency causes necrosis of the new leaves or leads to curled, contorted growth. Calcium concentrations in normal, most recently matured leaves are between 1.0 and 5.0 percent. Since Ca movement in the plant is related to transpiration, it follows that environmental conditions that affect transpiration also affect Ca movement. Therefore, it is important to consider irrigation and greenhouse environment control in the overall Ca fertilization programme. In addition, uptake of Ca can be affected by other ions, such as NH4+, Mg2+ and K+. These cations can compete with Ca for uptake by the root. These competing nutrients should not be supplied in excess of the plant’s requirements. Magnesium Magnesium is a component of several primary and secondary minerals in the soil, which are essentially insoluble as far as agriculture is concerned. These materials are the original sources of the soluble or available forms of Mg. Magnesium is also present in relatively soluble forms, and is found in ionic form (Mg2+) adhered to the soil colloidal complex. The ionic form is considered to be available to crops. Magnesium is absorbed by the plant in lower quantities than Ca. The absorption of Mg is also highly affected by competing ions, such as K+, Ca2+ and NH4+. Unlike Ca, Mg is mobile in the plant and deficiencies appear first on the lower leaves. Deficiency of Mg occurs in the form of intervenialchlorosis, which can lead to necrosis of the affected areas. On tomato leaves, advanced Mg deficiency leads to a mild purpling of the affected areas. Mg is usually found in concentrations of 0.2–0.8 percent in normal leaves. Conditions leading to deficiency include poorly designed fertilizer programmes supplying too little Mg or ones supplying excess K, Ca or ammonium N.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 224 MICRONUTRIENTS Seven elements are referred to as micronutrients, because they are required in small amounts – usually a few parts per million (ppm) in the plant tissue. Many research activities are addressing the relationships between micronutrient provision to plants and associated crop growth; trace elements, such as zinc, manganese and copper, are increasingly recognized as essential when aiming for better yields (Gianquinto et al., 2000; Mann et al., 2002; Rashid and Ryan, 2004; Gupta, 2005). There are various studies suggesting that better micronutrient supply to crops might result in more vigorous seedlings, lower vulnerability to plant diseases and, possibly, also improved drought resistance (Frossard et al., 2000; Bouis, 2003). An inadequate supply of one or more micronutrients can impair crop growth, restrict yields, reduce quality and enhance susceptibility to disease. Intensive cropping can increase the demand for micronutrients to a level higher than the soil can supply. Micronutrients are also important for soil bacteria and deficiencies can diminish the normal rate of soil processes such as mineralization of organic matter or N fixation. Most metallic micronutrients, in particular iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu), are involved in redox reactions contributing to energy transfer within or between enzymatic systems. They are involved in the major metabolic functions of plants, in particular photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen fixation and nutrient assimilation. • Iron is involved in the biochemical reactions that form chlorophyll and it is part of one of the enzymes responsible for the reduction of NO3-N to NH4- N. Other enzyme systems, such as catalase and peroxidise, also require Fe. • Copper is a component of several enzymes in plants and is part of a protein in the electron transport system in photosynthesis. • Zinc is involved in the activation of several enzymes in the plant and is required for the synthesis of indoleacetic acid (IAA), a growth regulator. • Manganese (Mn), which remains in cationic form in plant cells, is essential for the activation of several key enzymes involved in photosynthetic O2 evolution and other metabolic functions, including dehydrogenases, decarboxylases and peroxidises. Although the Fe, Zn, Cu and Mn requirements of plants are quantitatively low, their shortage results in severe metabolic disturbances due to their involvement in the central metabolic functions of plants. • Knowledge of boron (B) functions is limited because B appears to have secondary effects in plant nutrition. The most important physiological effects of B in plants are on the structural integrity of some polysaccharides in the cell walls and on membrane function, as well as a stimulation or inhibition of specific metabolic pathways. 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 225 • Molybdenum is a constituent of only two enzymes in plant metabolism: nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase. It is also a constituent of nitrogenase, an enzyme contained in symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium), and contributes to symbiotic fixation of atmospheric N2 in bean and other legumes. • Chlorine (Cl) plays a role in the evolution of O2 during photosynthesis and might function as a counter ion in K fluxes involved in cell turgor. Micronutrient sources and utilization by plant Most soils contain sufficient amounts of metallic micronutrients, specifically Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu, but their availability for plants may be inadequate, resulting in deficiencies if the pH in the rhizosphere is very high. There are major differences between crops in terms of their micronutrient requirements and sensitivity to deficiency. Micronutrients are often applied with NPK fertilizers, but when deficiency symptoms are visible, salts of micronutrients dissolved in water are sprayed onto the crop foliage. The most frequent problem at excessively high pH levels (e.g. in calcareous soils) is Fe deficiency. The best way to cope with this problem in the long term is to adjust the soil pH. On the other hand, an excessively low soil pH may induce toxicities of certain metallic micronutrients, especially Mn. If the pH of the greenhouse soil is lower or higher than the optimal range, it is recommended to carry out chemical analysis of the micronutrient concentrations in the leaves: if the concentration of any micronutrient is not optimal, a foliar micronutrient application may be beneficial, even where there are", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Iron Iron can be absorbed either as Fe2+ via an active process, or from Fe chelates which are organic molecules containing sequestered Fe. Uptake depends on the form of Fe, and adequate uptake depends on the ability of the root to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Iron chelates are soluble and help keep Fe in solution for uptake. The uptake of the whole chelate molecule is low and Fe is usually removed from the chelate prior to uptake. Iron is not mobile in plants and the first symptoms appear on the new leaves in the form of interveinalchlorosis resulting from a drastic reduction in the leaf chlorophyll content, that may progress to bleaching and necrosis of the affected leaves. Normal leaves contain 80–120 ppm Fe on a dry-weight basis. Conditions leading to Fe deficiency are inadequate concentrations of Fe in the nutrient solution, cold media or alkaline media conditions (pH > 7.0). GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 226 Manganese Manganese is absorbed as Mn2+ ions and the uptake is affected by other cations (e.g. Ca and Mg). Manganese is relatively immobile in the plant and deficiency symptoms appear on the upper leaves. The symptoms of deficiency of Mn are similar to those for Mg (except that with Mg deficiency they appear on the lower leaves of the plant). Mn deficiency results in interveinalchlorosis; however, the chlorosis is more speckled than with Mg deficiency. A normal concentration of Mn in leaves ranges from 30 to 125 ppm for most plants. High concentrations of Mn can be toxic to plants. Toxicity consists of marginal leaf necrosis in many plants. Concentrations of Mn in the order of 800–1 000 ppm can lead to toxicity in many crops. Excess Mn in the nutrient solution reduces uptake of Fe. Situations leading to deficiency are mostly related to inadequate Mn supply in the solution or to competition effects of other ions. Zinc Zinc uptake is thought to be an active process and can be affected by concentration of P in the media. Zn is not highly mobile in plants. The most characteristic visible symptoms of Zn deficiency are stunted growth (due to shortening of internodes) and decreased leaf size. These symptoms are often combined with leaf epinasty (downward curling of leaf blade), mottling interveinalchlorosis and necrosis. Normal leaves contain 25–50 ppm Zn. High concentrations of Zn can lead to toxicity where root growth is reduced and leaves are small and chlorotic. Zinc deficiency can be increased by cold, wet growing media or by media with a very high pH or with excessive P. Copper Copper is absorbed by plants in very small quantities. Uptake appears to be an active process and is strongly affected by Zn and pH. Copper is not highly mobile in plants but some Cu can be translocated from older to newer leaves. The normal level of Cu in plants is in the order of 5–20 ppm. Copper deficiency of young leaves leads to chlorosis and some elongation of the leaves. Excess Cu, especially in acidic media, can be toxic. Boron Boron uptake by plants is not well understood. It is not mobile in the plant and seems to have many uptake and transport features in common with Ca. Deficiency results in growth inhibition and necrosis of the apical meristems and young growing points (e.g. buds, leaf tips and margins), while boron toxicity imposes leaf chlorosis and necrosis symptoms. The sufficiency range for boron is narrow and requires careful monitoring. Normal leaves contain 20–40 ppm B, while high levels may result in toxicity. 10.

Plants need only small amounts of B; supplying excessive B from fertilizer solutions or from foliar sprays leads to toxicity. Molybdenum Molybdenum is absorbed as molybdate MoO42- and uptake is suppressed by sulphate. Tissue contents of Mo are usually less than 1 ppm. Due to the limited metabolic functions involving Mo, the plant requirements for this nutrient are very low and, therefore, a shortage of Mo in greenhouse crops is rare. Deficiency first appears in the mid leaves and older leaves; they become chlorotic and the margins roll. Unlike other micronutrients, Mo deficiency occurs mostly under acidic conditions. Chlorine The plant requirements for chlorine are very low and Cl exists in abundant quantities in the earth’s crust and also in fertilizers and water; therefore, a shortage of Cl in commercial greenhouse crops is highly unlikely. However, Cl availability in the root environment over and above the plant’s requirements may be beneficial, since Cl is utilized by plants as an osmolyte for cell turgor and may improve fruit quality. SEASONAL CHANGES IN CROP NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS The rate of crop mineral uptake and the mutual ratios by which different elements are absorbed by the roots are influenced by the environment (light, temperature and humidity) and vary considerably during the growing season, especially in long-cycle crops, such as fruit vegetables and perennial ornamental plants (rose, gerbera etc.). Indeed, variations in mineral uptake are observed also on a shorter time scale, for example during the 24-hour period, but they are less relevant for the practical management of fertilization. Many other factors influence the uptake of nutrients, in particular their concentrations and those of other elements (synergistic or antagonist effect), as well as pH, total salinity and moisture in the growing medium. However, the rate of nutrient uptake is driven principally by the demand associated with plant growth – although the actual uptake may increase when there is a luxury consumption of nutrients, or decrease when the formation of specific plant materials takes place with the contribution of stored nutrients. Luxury consumption occurs when the crop absorbs nutrients without having a corresponding increase in yield (Figure 1). In addition to waste of fertilizers, there are other potential drawbacks: lush growth; impairment of flower and fruit GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 228 formation; increased susceptibility to pests, diseases and fruit ripening disorders; worsening of harvested fruit quality (e.g. compositional and textural changes); and, in some crops, accumulation of free nitrates in edible organs, which are harmful to human health. Remobilization of stored nutrients is limited in herbaceous crops, like greenhouse vegetables, and plays an important role only in conditions of severe nutrient starvation, which are not realistic in well-managed greenhouse crops. A growth-dependent process, mineral uptake is influenced by the rate of photosynthesis and, therefore, it increases with radiation, provided the temperature and other growing conditions remain favourable. Table 3 shows how the uptake rate for water, N and K increases with irradiance.

Crop models based on the concept of uptake concentration have been criticized (e.g. Le Bot et al., 1998; Silberbush and Ben-Asher, 2001), because water and nutrient uptake are independent processes, despite the reciprocal influence, and thus the uptake concentration of different nutrients is difficult to predict. On the other hand, in many species the variation in ion uptake concentration is much less pronounced than the daily uptake rate (Sonneveld and Voogt, 2009; Carmassi et al., 2007; Gallardo et al., 2009). This happens because the rate of water uptake, which is dominated by leaf transpiration, responds promptly to the changes in crop dimensions (i.e. in leaf area) and environmental conditions, especially radiation. Therefore, the uptake concentration is often used for the management of fertigation in substrate culture (Gallardo et al., 2009; Sonneveld and Voogt, 2009), although it is necessary to consider the remarkable effect of radiation on nutrient uptake concentration. In fact, uptake concentration decreases with high radiation input as plant transpiration increases more than growth-driven mineral demand. The major reason for seasonal variation of crop mineral uptake, however, is ontogeny, which includes both growth and development and leads to the formation of different tissues and organs, each with its own mineral composition. Major changes occur as a result of the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. The nutrient concentration of reproductive organs (in particular fruits) is quite different from that of vegetative organs. Consequently, the allocation of different nutritive elements to vegetative and reproductive organs does not match the partitioning of dry matter (Figure 2), resulting in significant variation in the mutual ratios of the nutrients absorbed by vegetative and fruiting plants. For the definition of a fertilization programme and the interpretation of the tissue analysis results, the concentrations of many nutrients in leaves and other organs vary with physiological age. In general, the contents of N, P and K decline as the plant ages, while those of Ca, Mg, Mn and B often increase. Therefore, the optimum concentrations of mineral nutrients are generally lower in older plants than in younger plants. On the other hand, nutrient levels, in particular N, can be enhanced temporarily in mature plants as the result of a sudden increase in the nutrient availability in the root zone, for example, as a result of top-dressing or fertigation. Table 4 shows the progressive reduction of the critical concentration GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 230 (i.e. the minimum concentration allowing the maximum plant growth) of macronutrients in tomato leaves. The reduction of plant nutrient concentration with plant age has been extensively researched for N (Le Bot et al., 2001; Lemaire et al., 2008) and has been described as the “N dilution curve”, namely a negative power function of N concentration (%) against plant dry matter (DM, tonne ha-1): TABLE 4 Critical nutrient concentration in tomato leaves at different developmental stage (5-leaf stage, flower initiation and onset of fruit formation)* Nutrient Critical nutrient concentration (% DW) 5-leaf Flower initiation Fruit formation N 4.0 3.5 2.5 P 1.0 1.0 4.0 K 6.5 7.0 4.0–4.5 Ca 3.5 3.5 1.8–2.0 Mg 1.6–2.0 2.0 1.0 * Sample consisted of all healthy leaves on the plants, which were grown in a peat-based medium.

The concept of the N dilution curve accounts for the progressive decline of N uptake with crop growth. The following relationship between crop N uptake (NU) and DM production (with both quantities expressed in kg ha-1) was derived by Gallardo et al. (2009) from a greenhouse tomato spring crop: Eq. 2 To conclude, knowledge of the crop growth rate and critical nutrient concentration of plant tissues is crucial for efficient fertilization management. Crop modelling can be an excellent tool for predicting the actual mineral uptake of greenhouse plants based on environmental and growing conditions. However, crop models are not available for all greenhouse crops and, more importantly, their application on a commercial scale is not straightforward, especially in the low-tech greenhouse operations typical of Mediterranean regions. MINERAL NUTRITION, PLANT HEALTH AND PRODUCE QUALITY Nutrients and plant health As previously reported, too low or too high supply of a nutrient may result in deficiency or toxicity, with nutrient deficiencies more frequent than toxicities in commercial greenhouse crops. Sometimes, a too high supply of a nutrient can cause deficiency of another nutrient (rather than direct toxicity of the nutrient in excess) as a result of competitive restriction of its uptake. The visual diagnosis of nutrient deficiencies is not always easy since different nutrients can cause similar symptoms, while in some cases two or more nutrient deficiencies may coexist in the same plant. Nevertheless, a preliminary screening may be based on the physiological age of the leaves in which the symptoms first appear (Table 5). As a rule, nutrients that are highly mobile through the phloem may be remobilized from older leaves and retranslocated to young growing organs, should supply shortages occur. Hence, the symptoms of deficiency in these nutrients %𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁= 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀−𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁= 0.0699𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀0.9016 TABLE 5 Physiological age of leaves in which early deficiency symptoms appear, based on the mobility of plant nutrients through the phloem Old leaves N, P, K, Mg Intermediate to young leaves Mn, Mo Young leaves Ca, S, Fe, Zn, Cu, Shoot apices B GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 232 appear first in the older leaves. In contrast, nutrients with poor mobility through the phloem cannot be retranslocated from old to young leaves when their availability decreases. Deficiency symptoms for these nutrients therefore appear first in new vegetation in the upper plant. Nutrient imbalances can also interfere with physiological disorders. Most physiological disorders result from multiple factors related not only to plant nutrition but also to irrigation and environmental conditions; many affect the fruit and are detrimental to both marketable yield and fruit quality. Physiological disorders Physiological disorders in fruit can have a strong impact on the economic return of the greenhouse enterprises. A typical physiological disorder related to plant nutrition is blossom end rot (BER), affecting Solanaceae fruit crops (tomato, pepper and eggplant). Blossom end rot usually begins as a small water- soaked area at the blossom end of the fruit and then develops into a dry rot. This disorder is ascribed to a local shortage of Ca in the distal part of the fruit, resulting in tissue disorganization due to impairment of plasma membranes or cell walls. Environmental conditions (e.g. low relative humidity in the air, high air temperature and solar radiation intensity) and fertilization and irrigation management may restrict the translocation of Ca to the affected part of the fruit. In most cases, the fruit Ca level correlates poorly with the appearance of BER – presumably because the fruit cell damage caused by Ca shortage occurs during a period of rapid cell elongation, while the visible symptoms do not appear until later, when the Ca supply has recovered. While eggplant is less susceptible to BER than tomato or pepper, some cultivars may be affected by another disorder caused by local shortage of Ca in the fruit: internal", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

In most cases, the fruit Ca level correlates poorly with the appearance of BER – presumably because the fruit cell damage caused by Ca shortage occurs during a period of rapid cell elongation, while the visible symptoms do not appear until later, when the Ca supply has recovered. While eggplant is less susceptible to BER than tomato or pepper, some cultivars may be affected by another disorder caused by local shortage of Ca in the fruit: internal fruit rot (Savvas and Lenz, 1994). It first appears as an uneven, wet area in part of the external fruit surface; below this uneven area, the fruit tissue has a wet, blackened and disintegrated appearance, resulting from the bursting and disorganization of cells. At a later stage, the skin may crack, followed by excretion of a black juice. Another physiological disorder related to plant nutrition is the occurrence of colour spots or flecks in tomato and pepper fruit. Tomato is mainly affected by gold specks, caused by an excess of Ca deposition in the cell walls. Undesired colour spots or flecks may also appear in pepper as a result of inappropriate plant nutrition. The occurrence of colour spots in pepper can be reduced by applying high rates of nitrogen fertilization and by shading the crop to reduce solar radiation intensity. In soilless culture, the incidence of white flecks and green spots may be reduced by increasing the strength of the nutrient solution (higher electrical conductivity). 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 233 Blotchy ripening occurs in tomato fruit and it is associated with nutrition. While most of the fruit surface turns red on ripening, some patches remain strikingly green, grey or yellow. When grey patches are prevalent, the disorder may also be known as “grey wall”. Blotchy ripening is more likely to occur when there are relatively low nutrient concentrations in the root zone; an inverse relationship between the percentage of unevenly ripened fruits and the levels of K and N in the root zone of tomato has been reported (Adams et al., 1978). Yellow shoulder disorder (YSD) is a ripening disorder of tomato. It is characterized by discoloration of the proximal-end tissues of the fruit, which remain yellow or green, while the rest of the fruit surface turns red. YSD incidence would appear to be influenced by K, N and P supply. Enhanced (though not excessive) fertilization with K improves fruit colour in tomato, while at the same time it reduces the incidence of yellow shoulder and other fruit colour disorders. Fruit cracking in tomato and pepper depends on plant nutrition. It occurs when the internal fruit expands more rapidly than the epidermis, causing the latter to split. Incidence of fruit cracking can be decreased by reinforcing the cell walls and membranes. Certain types of cracking are considered Ca-related disorders. Mineral deficiency or excess can increase the crop’s susceptibility to physiological disorders and diseases during storage. Excess nitrogen increases the incidence of bacterial (Erwinia carotovora) soft rot and internal browning in tomatoes and aggravates the severity of stem cracking (or brown checking) in celery, associated with B deficiency (Bartz et al., 1979). BOX 6 How to restrict the occurrence of blossom end rot (BER) in Solanaceae fruits • Use non-susceptible cultivars to BER. • Take measures to maintain the relative humidity levels > 60% in the greenhouse air during the hot season of the year to avoid excessive transpiration rate. • Avoid too high air temperatures inside the greenhouse during the hot season of the year. • Avoid excessive K or Mg supply via fertlization. • Supply only part of nitrogen in the form of NH4-N, because NH4-N aggravates the incidence of BER. • Avoid high salinity levels in the root zone. • During the winter, maintain a root temperature of 18-20 °C at night. • Ensure that the soil Ca level is adequate, especially if plants are grown in a sandy or acidic soil, or the SOM is very high. • If the above measures are not effective enough, spray the very young fruit with a 0.5% solution of calcium chloride. • Remove consistently all plant leaves below the clusters to be harvested, especially under warm weather conditions.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 234 Nutrients and quality of produce Produce quality may be defined as the degree to which a series of extrinsic or intrinsic characteristics of a given product fulfil the requirements expressed by the consumers: quality represents the conformance to preset specifications (standards). In recent years, in developed countries, the idea of quality for fresh vegetables has changed significantly, depending on numerous factors and incorporating social and cultural connotations. Fresh vegetables are commonly selected by consumers on the basis of their appearance and price; but repeated purchase depends not so much on price as on other attributes (e.g. organoleptic and nutritional value) – at least on some markets. Consumers also expect produce to be free of pesticide residues. The organoleptic quality of fresh products is generally attributed to their colour, flavour, and content of sugar, acids and volatiles; freshness in leafy vegetables and firmness and juiciness in fruits are also important. Interest in the nutritional and health benefits of fresh vegetables has grown in recent years. In general, vegetables contain biologically active substances, as well as nutrients, including pro-vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, folate, potassium, magnesium, digestible and non-digestible (fibre) carbohydrates, proteins and secondary metabolites (flavonoids and carotenoids, mainly); they lack saturated fat and transfatty acids, and contain a low amount of Na (with some exceptions). Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet, and adequate daily consumption can prevent a whole range of diseases and disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases. Year-round availability, post-harvest shelf-life, adequate packaging and special presentations (e.g. ready-to-eat products) are all important quality criteria for fresh vegetables. Moreover, consumers increasingly wish to know how and where products were cultivated and more environment-friendly cropping systems are expected. The greater the number of attributes and benefits demanded by consumers, the more fresh vegetables cease to be commodities and become specialties; their added value and price naturally increase as a result. Certification of product quality, provided by big retail companies (super- and hypermarkets) or by independent entities on the basis of regulations promulgated by national or transnational (e.g. European Union) governments, is now applied to most greenhouse fresh vegetables. Growers are motivated to improve their growing techniques and to apply quality management systems in all phases of production, including post-harvest handling and storage. Fertilization is a potential tool not only to control crop yield, but also to improve quality and sensorial aspects while respecting the environment. The case studies that follow aim to illustrate how appropriate management of mineral nutrition, including the application of specific fertilizers, may improve product quality and facilitate its marketability. 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 235 Controlling nitrate accumulation in vegetables Nitrate is a natural substance that per se is not toxic to humans; however, it may lead to the formation of nitrite, nitric oxide and N-nitrous compounds, with potential health effects, including methaemoglobinaemia and carcinogenesis. A dose of 222 mg per day for a 60 kg adult was recognized as the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of nitrate by the FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives in 2002. In humans, nitrate intake is mainly associated with the consumption of vegetables and, to a lesser extent, of water and other foods and beverages (e.g. beer). In plants, high levels of nitrate can be found in leaves, while much lower levels occur in fruits, seeds or root organs. Herbs (e.g. basil and coriander), leafy vegetables (e.g. lettuce, spinach and rocket) and stems (e.g. celery) have a good capacity for accumulating large amounts of nitrate in their leaves (up to 15–20 g kg-1 FW); on the other hand, a much lower content is generally found in brassicas, fruit vegetables (with the exception of zucchini and pumpkin), legumes, tubers, bulbs and mushrooms (EFSA, 2008; Table 6). High vitamin-C content – typical of many vegetables – may prevent the conversion of nitrate to nitrite in plant tissue and within the human body, thus further reducing the risk of nitrate toxicity. Moreover, it has been found that nitrate metabolites (e.g. nitric oxide) have", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The EU has set certain limits for the nitrate content of vegetables for fresh consumption or processing, for example, for baby food production (EC Regulation No. 1881/2006).

On the other hand, no nitrate standards have been introduced in the United States (Santamaria, 2006). Excessive nitrate accumulation in plant tissues occurs when there is an imbalance between root uptake and nitrate assimilation in the leaves. Growing conditions reducing the rate of photosynthesis while root uptake of nitrate remains relatively high inevitably results in nitrate accumulation, especially in the leaves (even more in their petioles), following the transportation of nitrate through the transpiration stream. Indeed, nitrate tends to accumulate in transpiring organs (e.g. leaves), while fruits, seeds and storage organs (tubers and bulbs) have relatively small concentrations. Leaf nitrate content is generally higher early in the morning than in the afternoon, due to the lower availability of photosynthetic products (sugars, assimilatory power) that slow down the nitrate transformation. Low radiation is the main factor responsible for excessive nitrate accumulation. Nitrate levels in plant tissues therefore tend to be higher in northern countries, in winter and under cover in comparison to southern countries, in summer and field cultivation (EFSA, 2008). Intriguingly, the EU limits on nitrate content in vegetables depend on the season and growing system – it would seem that agronomic considerations outweigh any health concern (Table 7). BOX 7 Measures for reducing nitrate accumulation in leafy vegetables Soil and soilless culture • Select cultivars known for lower nitrate accumulation. • Increase light transmission of greenhouse cover. • Remove outer leaves from head vegetable. • Split nitrogen top-dressing. • Do not apply N fertilization shortly before harvest. • Check nitrate concentration in leaf or petiole sap with quick nitrate test. Soil culture • Use ammonium instead of nitrate. • Check soil nitrate level. • Harvest crop in the afternoon. • Split nitrogen top-dressing and suspend it well before harvest. Soilless culture • Remove nitrate from nutrient solution a few days before harvest. • Replace part of nitrate with chloride. 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 237 Biofortification of vegetables Humans need many mineral elements and they are supplied by food. In some regions, however, populations are at risk of deficiency of certain minerals, for example Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg, Cu, iodine (I) and selenium (Se), due to limited dietary variety or poor levels of these elements in their food. Conventional strategies to solve mineral deficiencies are direct supplementation or food fortification. Biofortification represents an alternative strategy: the increase of the bio-available concentrations of an element in food crops by means of fertilization and plant breeding (either conventional or based on recombinant DNA technology) (White and Broadley, 2005; Ríos et al., 2008; Voogt et al., 2010). However, biofortification of greenhouse vegetables seems to be more of a marketing than a health policy tool, as greenhouse products are principally sold in developed countries where populations have good access to many micronutrient-rich (e.g. meat, fish, poultry and dairy products) or fortified (e.g. table salt) foods and therefore are", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

In Italy, a few field-grown vegetables (potatoes and onions) enriched with Se or I (by foliar application or fertigation) have been successfully launched on the market. Nevertheless, the real advantages of consuming these products still need to be assessed; there is concern about consumption by people not at risk of malnutrition and therefore having a potential overintake of micronutrients. From a technical point of view, micronutrient biofortification is achieved through foliar or soil application (preplanting, top-dressing or fertigation) of specific salts (e.g. potassium selenate or selenite, potassium iodine or iodate) or fertilizers enriched with the element of interest. Hydroponic culture simplifies vegetable biofortification, as the micronutrient can be dissolved directly in the nutrient solution. This cultural method generally facilitates plant mineral uptake and increases the efficiency of micronutrient application. Micronutrient supplements can positively influence plant growth (most of them are essential TABLE 7 Maximum levels (limits) for the nitrate (mg kg-1 fresh matter) in lettuce and spinach according to European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 563/200272 Product Harvest period NO3 Fresh spinacha (Spinacia oleracia L.)

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 238 plant elements) and improve product quality. For example, the application of Se can enhance the shelf-life of fresh-cut leafy vegetables, because it interferes with ethylene synthesis. Some authors have proposed hydroponic cultivation of metal-accumulating species (e.g. Brassica juncea) in order to grow dried plant products containing multiple minerals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cr, Se, V and Mo) as dietary supplements. Hydroponics has also been used to enrich vegetables with nutritional factors such as W-3-fatty acid. All programmes for micronutrient enrichment of greenhouse vegetables must be supported by comprehensive risk-benefit analysis followed by appropriate communication to consumers, assessing, for example: risks of overdose; negative health effects; possible micronutrient accumulation in the soil; and leaching to ground- or surface water. Quality of hydroponically grown vegetables Literature provides contrasting evidence; nevertheless, hydroponics generally enables the production of vegetables of quality comparable to those grown in soil (Gruda, 2009). Some species, such as tomato, cucumber, pepper, strawberry and almost all leafy plants (lettuce, rocket salad, basil, celery), seem to respond better to hydroponic culture than other crops, such as eggplant and muskmelon. For example, reduced sweetness and firmness of hydroponically grown muskmelons is often observed (Pardossi et al., 2000). Moreover, leafy and fruit vegetables produced hydroponically do not contain the residues of chemicals used for soil disinfection or other soil pollutants and, usually, they are very clean – a crucial factor for strawberry and ready-to-eat leaf and shoot vegetables (microgreens, baby leaves), the consumption of which is rapidly increasing in many countries. Cultivation of strawberries in suspended bag culture reduces labour costs for planting and harvesting, and significantly reduces susceptibility to grey mould (Botrytis cinerea). Proper manipulation of the culture solution can substantially improve nutritional or sanitary characteristics – for example, to reduce the level of nitrates. NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT TO MAXIMIZE YIELD AND MINIMIZE NUTRIENT LOSS Fertilization accounts for a relatively small proportion of total production costs of greenhouse crops (< 5–10%); what is more, there is a general (partial) misconception that abundant nutrient application is needed for high yield and quality.

As a result, growers tend to overfertilize. Crop production is not linearly related to the level of fertilization: with knowledge of the crop nutrient requirements as a whole and of how the mineral uptake rate and mutual ratio change during the growing season it is possible to optimize mineral supply and maximize crop growth, reduce the amount (and cost) of applied fertilizers, and minimize the amount of unused nutrients destined to accumulate in the soil and be emitted in the ground- and surface water. 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 239 Mineral fertilizers A fertilizer is a mined, refined or manufactured product containing one or more essential plant nutrients in available or potentially available forms and in commercially valuable amounts without carrying any harmful substance above permissible limits (FAO, 2006). Prefixes (synthetic, mineral, inorganic, artificial, chemical etc.) are often used interchangeably to describe fertilizers. Although organic fertilizers are being prepared and used, the term “fertilizer” does not actually include them, for reasons of tradition and because of their generally much lower nutrient content (FAO, 2006). Fertilizers are traditionally classified as follows: • Single-nutrient or straight fertilizers containing one of the three major nutrients (N, P, K). They often include secondary nutrients (e.g. elemental S, magnesium sulphate, calcium oxide). • Complex or compound fertilizers containing at least two of the three major nutrients. They are produced by a chemical reaction between the raw materials containing the desired nutrients and are generally solid granulated products. They include both two-nutrient (NP) and three-nutrient (NPK) fertilizers. The available plant nutrients in fertilizers (fertilizer grade) are expressed as a percentage by weight in a fertilizer. For example, a 12–32–16 grade of NPK complex fertilizer indicates the presence of 12% nitrogen (N), 32% phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and 16% potash (K2O). On a fertilizer bag, the NPK content is always written in the sequence: N, P2O5, K2O. There are a wide variety of N, P and K fertilizers that can be applied in greenhouses through fertilization and fertigation (Table 8). The choice of fertilizer used for fertigation is mainly based on solubility and on residual contents of salts (not usually harmful to the plants but can cause clogging of drippers).

The most commonly used contain N as NO3, NH4 or urea; generally, urea is not used for soilless production. • P fertilizers. Orthophosphates are usually applied. Calcium orthophosphates are the cheapest and most widely used on soil-grown crops, but they are never used in fertigation or soilless production as they include many insoluble components. Moreover, many P fertilizers contain fluorine (F), which is toxic for some crops, especially bulbous and tubercles; for such crops, P fertilizers with a low F content are found on the market. • K fertilizers. The most widely used are K sulphates. Potassium chloride (KCl) is never applied on greenhouse soil-grown crops, but in soilless crops it may be used when Cl is required in the nutrient solution and the concentration in the irrigation water is very low. Kieserite is the most common contributor of Mg to crops, although it is not very soluble in cold water. For fertigation and soilless systems, Epsom salt is preferred.

Many Ca fertilizers have a double function, because they are also used as pH regulators, for example CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2. However, when only Ca supply is required, Ca(NO3)2 is normally applied. Micronutrient availability depends on several factors, including the pH of the soil and nutrient solution. Many are applied as sulphates (SO4); chlorides (Cl) and nitrates (NO3) are also used. Iron is applied through chelates, which are soluble and help keep Fe in the solution for uptake (Box 8). The uptake of the whole chelate molecule is low and Fe is usually removed from the chelate prior to uptake. Chelates most widely used in agriculture are EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid), DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) and EDDHA (ethylene diamine di-o- hydroxyphenylacetic acid). Other chelate compounds are HEDTA (hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine triacetic acid) amino acids, humic-fluivic acids and citrate. The choice of iron chelate depends on the pH of nutrient solution and growing media that affects the stability of chelates and the availability of Fe.

Soil fertility and plant nutrition 241 The fertilizer industry also produces compound fertilizers. Normally, these fertilizers are composed of N, P and K in varying ratios. The newest products also include secondary cells as Mg and micronutrients. They are widely used, especially in open field crops, but problems may arise from their application: • Many N-P-K compound fertilizers include large amounts of sulphates (SO4). • They generally contain unnecessarily high quantities of P. • Their fixed composition frequently does not match with the nutrients already available and consequently with the crop requirement for N, P and K. Indeed, in greenhouse production it is advisable to apply simple N, P and K fertilizers to optimize nutrient management. Other forms of fertilizer available are controlled- or slow-release fertilizers, coated in a substance to enable a slow rate of release. There are four main categories: • Plastic-coated fertilizers (e.g. Osmocote) are spheres coated with plastic and containing water-soluble fertilizer. The spheres are generally 3 mm BOX 8 What are iron chelates Chelates are compounds that stabilize Fe3+ ion and other positively charged metal ions (Zn+2, Mn+2 and Cu+2) and protect them from oxidation and precipitation. Different chelates hold Fe ions in different strengths at different pH levels. They also defer in their susceptibility to Fe replacement by competitive ions. For example, at high concentrations, Ca or Mg ions may replace the chelated metal ion. • Fe-EDTA is stable at pH below 6.0. Above pH of 6.5, nearly 50% of the Fe is unavailable. Therefore, this chelate is ineffective in alkaline soils. This chelate also has high affinity to Ca, so it is advised not to use it in Ca-rich soils or water. • Fe-DTPA is stable in pH levels of up to 7.0, and is not as susceptible to iron replacement by calcium. • Fe-EDDHA is stable at pH levels as high as 11.0, but it is also the most expensive iron chelate available. In soilless media and hydroponics, pH monitoring and control of water and media is easier than in soils. When regular testing is performed, and pH control is adequate, it is possible to prefer the inexpensive, less stable Fe chelates.

The most common is MagAmp (7-40-6, N-P-K formulation). This kind of fertilizer may reduce the availability of Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn due to the high level of phosphate. Ammonium toxicity may also be a problem with a low pH. • Urea aldehydes contain high levels of N. The most common type is urea formaldehyde. These fertilizers are mineralized by micro-organisms that break them down releasing N plant uptake. • Sulphur-coated fertilizers include many fertilizer types that are coated separately with sulphur and a sealant, then mixed together. The fertilizer is released by soil micro-organisms. In greenhouses these types of fertilizer are not usually used since slow fertilizer release frequently does not match the crop nutrient uptake rate. Moreover, nutrient release from fertilizers is out of control as it depends on many factors (e.g. temperature and soil moisture, activity of soil micro-organisms). Organic manures and fertilizers Organic manures and fertilizers are derived principally from substances of plant and animal origin. These sources cover manures made from cattle dung, excreta of other animals, other animal wastes, rural and urban wastes, composts, crop residues and green manures. The term organic manure is used collectively for cattle dung, FYM (farmyard manure), composts etc., all of which have a large volume in relation to the nutrients contained in them. Organic manures act primarily on the physical and biophysical components of soil fertility. They are normally applied to increase the level of organic matter and the abundance of micro-organisms in the soil, thus improving soil biodiversity and the physical properties of the soil. Improvement in soil aggregation with the application of organic manure results in increased porosity, hydraulic conductivity, infiltration rate, and water-holding capacity, and decreased bulk density and penetration resistance. Indeed, they are also referred to as “soil improvers” (FAO, 1998). Determining the correct amount of manure to apply is difficult. Manure samples should be analysed for nutrient content and levels of metals (e.g. Cu) often present in poultry litter. Nitrogen available to the plant is lower than the content in the samples: loss occurs through volatilization with spreading, and only part of the organic N becomes available to plants through mineralization during the growing season. 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 243 “Organic fertilizer” refers to concentrated organic manures (e.g. oilcakes, slaughterhouse waste, guano) and they must normally contain a minimum 5 percent of nutrients (N + P2O5 + K2O) (FAO, 2006). The raw materials used for organic fertilizer preparation are processed by drying, shredding, mixing, granulating, odour removal, pH modification, partial fermentation and composting, and always with proper hygienic control (FAO, 2006). This process provides standard products with certified concentrations of organic matter, a definite C:N ratio, guaranteed nutrient concentrations, and products without growth-impeding substances or sanitary problems (FAO, 2006). Finally, they are also easy to store and handle. Organic fertilizers are used where low nutrient concentrations and slow-acting N sources are preferred. Some of these are important inputs in organic farming. Commercial organic fertilizers are classified as follows (FAO, 2006): • Organic N fertilizers (≥ 5% N, often higher) • Organic P fertilizers, mainly from bones (e.g. 25% P2O5) • Organic NP fertilizers (≥ 3% N and 12% P2O5) • Organic NPK fertilizers (≥ 15% N, P2O5 and K2O) • Organomineral NP or NPK fertilizers, supplemented by mineral fertilizer or guano (e.g. NP with ≥ 5% each of N and P2O5, or NPK with ≥ 4% each of N, P2O5 and K2O) • Organomineral fertilizers based on peat, but with nutrient supplements. The most generally used organic fertilizers and soil improvers in greenhouse crops (Table 10) are similar to those habitually applied in open field cultivation (Elherradi et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2007).

The assessment of the plant nutrient status, especially in greenhouses, is used as a diagnostic tool to identify possible nutrient deficiencies or toxicities during cropping. Plant tissue analyses for screening the plant nutrient status are usually conducted when plants exhibit visible signs of nutrient disturbances or poor growth, although in some cases they may be used preventively as a monitoring tool to guide fertilization. Sampling and analysis of soil nutrients The classic approach for estimating plant nutrient availability in the soil is the determination of exchangeable nutrient cations, based on the use of acetic acid and DTPA solutions for the extraction of plant available macro- and microcations, respectively. The target level for some cations (e.g. K) may vary in relation to soil texture (Table 12). However, the determination of exchangeable cations is laborious and time-consuming, since it requires the drying of soil samples. Furthermore, this method is restricted only to cations, while the determination of essential nutrients occurring as anions (P, N) or uncharged compounds (B) requires other procedures, for example the Olsen method, which is routinely used to estimate the plant available P in Mediterranean soils (Olsen and Sommers, 1982). Using the bulk density of the soil, it is possible to convert all soil nutrient concentrations into kg ha-1 – a sound basis for estimating fertilizer application dosages. However, to convert soil nutrient concentrations into kg per cultivated greenhouse area, it is necessary to define the soil depth utilized by plant roots for nutrient acquisition. In long-term greenhouse crops, such as tomato, a soil depth of 60 cm is used as a basis for calculating the available nutrient reserves in the soil. However, nutrient concentrations change with increasing soil depth; therefore, for an accurate calculation of the soil nutrient status, soil samples from different TABLE 11 Desired levels of exchangeable cations, plant available P (Olsen) and B (hot water extraction) in greenhouse soils based on experience and standard laboratory practices (mg kg-1 dried soil) Nutrient Desired range Nutrient Desired range Ca 1 200–5 000 Fe 5–150 Mg 60–350 Mn 2–80 K 120–500 Zn 0.7–2 Na > 500 Cu 0.5–2 P 10–40 B 0.3–1.5 TABLE 12 Interpretation of soil test values for exchangeable K in relation to soil texture Rating Exchangeable K (mg kg-1 soil) Sandy soils (1,2,4) a Loamy soils (5,6,7,8) Clay and silty soils (3,9,10,11,12) Very low < 40 < 60 < 80 Low 40–80 60–100 80–120 Medium 81–120 101–150 121–180 High > 120 > 150 > 180 a Soil texture classification (see Box 1).

In most cases, soil samples from 0–30 and 30–60 cm soil layers are taken, but the collection of samples from shallower soil layers (0–20, 20–40 and 40–60 cm) is also possible. In greenhouse-grown plants developing a flat-root system, such as lettuce, soil sampling at a depth of 0–30 or 0–40 cm is sufficient to estimate the amounts of available nutrients in the soil. Determination of plant nutrient status The first level in assessing the plant nutrient status is based on visual observation of the plant. Although visual estimation is a subjective means of diagnosing the plant nutrient status, it is very important, first because it is the cheapest and most rapid, and second because it enables a first screening.

Although visual estimation is a subjective means of diagnosing the plant nutrient status, it is very important, first because it is the cheapest and most rapid, and second because it enables a first screening. Nevertheless, in many cases, an estimation of the plant nutrient status by means of chemical analysis may be needed, either to confirm suspected nutritional disorders, or to exclude them if the symptoms do not point to a typical nutrient deficiency or toxicity. To assess the nutrient status in greenhouse plants, leaf samples are collected from representative plants and subjected to chemical analysis in a laboratory. The physiological age of the leaves used for the analysis is extremely important, because the levels of most nutrients exhibit a concentration gradient with increasing leaf age. The results obtained from the chemical analysis are compared with optimal concentration ranges suggested in various literature sources (Hanan 1998; Mills and Jones, 1996), which are specific for each nutrient and cultivated plant species. However, the establishment of an optimal concentration range for a particular nutrient is based on a series of measurements in leaves of a well-defined physiological age (e.g. fifth leaf from the top of the stem, or the leaf above or below the youngest fruit). Therefore, when optimal concentration ranges are given for the leaves of cultivated plants aiming to diagnose nutritional disorders, these are always accompanied by a description of the physiological age of the leaves to be sampled. In most cases, the recommendation for greenhouse vegetables is to sample and analyse the youngest fully grown leaves (Tables 13 and 14). Sampled leaves should be washed carefully with distilled water to remove dust or other compounds on the leaf surface. The leaf samples are then oven- dried at 65–105 °C to reach a constant weight. A temperature of 65–70 °C is commonly used to determine the leaf N concentration, because at higher temperatures some N may escape in the form of volatile N compounds. Higher temperature levels (up to 105 °C) are permissible only when samples are used exclusively to determine metallic macronutrient concentrations. The dried leaves are powdered and passed through a 40-mesh sieve (0.42-mm openings). To determine the concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and B in the leaf tissues, a specific quantity (500 mg) of the powdered leaf sample is weighed and subjected to dry ashing in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 5 hours. The nutrients are extracted from the leaf ash using a HCl solution at a concentration of 1 M – a procedure known as dry ashing. These nutrients can also GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 246 be extracted by applying wet ashing, using a mixture of HNO3 and HClO4 as extractants (Kalra, 1998). The concentrations of the above nutrients in the filtered extract are preferably measured by plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP). If an ICP instrument is not available, phosphorus and B are measured colourimetrically, while the metallic nutrient elements are measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The leaf potassium concentration can be accurately measured using flame photometry. The concentration of organically bound N in the leaves is usually measured colourimetrically as NH4-N after a Kjeldhal digestion (Mills and Jones, 1996). The inorganic fraction of the leaf N (NO3-N) can also be colourimetrically determined in water extracts. The NO3- fraction of the leaf N is much smaller than that of the organic N and is not normally measured. Overall, the measurement of the organic leaf N concentration in leaves by means of the Kjeldhal method renders a reliable estimation of the plant N status.

Soil fertility and plant nutrition 247 More recent efforts aim to develop rapid, non-invasive methods for determining the plant nutrient status, such as multispectral measurements of colour parameters in leaves and other plant tissues, radiation reflexion, volatile emission etc. Multispectral imaging may be deployed as a means of measuring nutrient status at a canopy level. Nutrients budget of crops in greenhouse and estimation of optimal fertilizer rate and management Nitrogen N fertilization is the most important component of GAP related to plant nutrition, since excessive N supply may raise the nitrate concentrations in edible plant parts and groundwater to harmful levels for human health. Therefore, the N availability in the soil prior to the establishment of the crop is presumably the most important information needed to apply environment- and consumer-friendly fertilization practices in greenhouses. However, the determination of plant-available nitrogen in the soil is not a simple issue, because N in a cultivated field comes from various sources and is removed through loss processes and ultimately with the harvested crop. Such processes can be grouped into two categories (Table 15): TABLE 15 N budget of the crop: input adds N to the stock of mineral N in the soil; output removes mineral N from the soil Input of N Output of N Initial mineral N at planting *a Net mineralization *b Atmospheric deposition c N in organic manures (animal manure and compost) *d N in crop residues e N in N-fixing legumes included in rotation f N with fertilizers *g N in irrigation water *h Uptake by the crop *i Denitrification *j Volatilization *j Leaching k Soil erosion c Residual mineral N *l * Input-output relevant to greenhouse cropping systems. a Initial amount of mineral N in the soil at planting; measured by soil analysis. b Amount of net mineralization during the growing season, net mineralization being the difference between gross (real) mineralization and immobilization in relation to the C:N ratio of SOM. c N added by atmospheric deposition and N lost by soil erosion is negligible in greenhouse. d Ammonium and nitrate incorporated, e.g. with manures. e Only when the aerial part of previous crop has been incorporated into the soil.

Residual N is not directly a loss but in Mediterranean greenhouses it may represent a risk for salinization of the soil. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 248 • Input of N, including the amount of mineral N initially already available and N becoming available as a result of various processes that take place in the soil plus external supply. • Output of N, including processes and factors that diminish the amount of mineral N in the soil. Mineral N left at harvest is called residual N and is also regarded as an output term. Proper N management means that numbers need to be assigned to each of the items on the budget, on condition that losses and residual N are minimized, while the utilization of N from all sources is maximized. Deciding optimal fertilizer rates and times for N dressing is a major challenge in greenhouse horticulture. A common procedure to estimate the N that must be supplied with N fertilization to satisfy the N crop requirement is the N balance sheet method. The N balance sheet is frequently determined as follows (CRPV, 2010): Eq. 3 where: Nf = N supplied with fertilization (kg N ha-1) Y = expected crop yield (tonnes ha-1) fN = the amount of N that crop takes up for each tonne of produce (kg N tonne-1 produce) Np = N readily available (NO3--N fraction) in the soil at planting as assessed through soil analysis (kg N ha-1) Nm = N mineralized from SOM during growing season, estimated by SOM content and C:N ratio, and soil texture (kg N ha-1) Nr = N mineralized from residues of previous crop, estimated on the basis of origin and management (incorporated into the soil or not) (kg N ha-1) Ns = N mineralized from organic N sources (manure, compost etc.) distributed in previous years, estimated on the basis of type and amount of organic matter and frequency of its distribution (kg N ha-1) Estimating the N availability in the greenhouse soil prior to planting is complicated by the difficulty of predicting the mineralization rate of the organic matter during the cropping period. Therefore, if the organic matter content of the soil is not very high, only the inorganic fraction of the soil N, particularly the sum of NO3--N and NH4-N, is measured and taken into consideration to estimate the crop needs for N fertilization. This approach is based on the assumption that the organic-N fraction in the soil represents an N-reserve that has to be constantly maintained from year to year, while the contribution of crop residues (e.g. roots) is neglected. However, since the NH4-N is rapidly converted into NO3--N in the soil, most laboratories routinely estimate only the NO3--N fraction in the soil and use this as an estimate of the total plant available nitrogen. If the NO3--N fraction 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓= (𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌× 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁) −൫𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝+ 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚+ 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟+ 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠൯ 10.

If an immediate measurement is not possible, the soil samples have to be frozen to -20 °C. To express the soil N content on a standard basis, the moisture content of the soil is also determined using a subsample to allow for conversion of the measured values to mg of N per kg of dry soil.

CRPV, 2010 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 250 Such balances, however, are actually simplified and may lead to misestimated Nf. For example, they do not consider some items on the N budget, such as the outflow related to the N losses through leaching, denitrification or volatilization, and the inflow due to N contained in water irrigation (Box 9). In addition, they do not take into account the efficiency of utilization of applied N fertilizer. Although N in fertilizers is usually in forms rapidly available to plants, it is never fully utilized by the crop, even under optimal conditions. The crop takes up a part of the applied N, while a portion is left in the soil and lost through leaching, denitrification and volatilization. The fraction of fertilizer N taken up by the crops varies from 0.3 (Pilbeam, 1996) to more than 0.9 of N applied (Addiscott, 1996). It is affected by many factors, including type of fertilizer, timing of application, crop species, climate and soil conditions. To adjust the amount of N to apply to the crop, Nf would be divided by that fraction, as follows: Eq. 5 where: Na = the adjusted amount of N supplied with fertilization (kg N ha-1) Ea = the efficiency of utilization of N applied (fraction) 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎= 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓/𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 BOX 9 How to calculate the N input from irrigation A drip-irrigated tomato, grown on soil in a greenhouse in the Mediterranean area, requires frequent watering.

If irrigation is repeated 25 times during a 5-month growing season, the total input will be 150 kg ha-1 of NO3-, of which 22.6% (or in this case 33.9 kg) is N, an amount that should be taken into account in the N balance. 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 251 Since Ea is often uncertain, a so-called safety margin may be used. The safety margin is determined experimentally and its role is to prevent N shortage that might occur if only the amount of N required for uptake is present in the soil. It is an amount of supplemental N that takes into account both the fraction of fertilizer N taken up by the crop and N that could be lost by leaching and other processes. The safety margin varies with the crop from less than 30 to 90 kg N ha-1; for crops with small, shallow roots, the safety margin is relatively large, while plants with long, deep, extensive root systems, and a long growing season require only a small safety margin. Thus, the adjusted amount of N to apply to the crop, Nf, will be calculated as follows: Eq. 6 where: SM is the safety margin for the crop (kg N ha-1) Although the use of these adjusting factors improves Nf, its calculation maintains a high degree of uncertainty. For example, yields are forecast by taking an average of recent yield data from the field or area. But yields differ from year to year, and the true crop need for N is not known before harvest. Moreover, the values of crop N-uptake (fN) vary widely in the literature. On the other hand, the soil analyses used to determine the N soil content are based on the measurement of the mineral N (Np) at the beginning of the growing season and an estimation of the N mineralization (Nm, Nr and Ns) during crop growth (pre-crop, organic matter content, organic fertilizer application etc.). However, for figures to be considered reliable, farmers need to perform frequent soil tests, which become costly and time-consuming. Nevertheless, the mineralization rate of SOM depends upon the temperature and moisture of the soil, as well as C/N; if not taken into account, the calculation will be imprecise. Although application of the N balance sheet allows for a more reliable calculation of crop N requirement than a rule of thumb, other strategies should be pursued. Diagnostic tools in crop N management have recently been developed and applied, revealing several advantages in terms of reliability and cost- effectiveness (Gianquinto et al., 2005 and 2011). These methods include the petiole sap nitrate test, the chlorophyll meter and test kits for soil analysis. In Mediterranean greenhouses, all fertilizer N is often applied either preplanting or at the time of planting, or sometimes split in the early part of the growing season. This is an unsustainable way to manage the large amounts of N fertilizer supplied, as it frequently results in pollution and soil salinization.

Correct N application entails a low N rate supplied at planting (starter rate of 20–40 kg N ha-1), and the rest of N split in several applications during the growing season. The best results can be achieved by matching the N supply to the crop's requirements at each growth stage through variable rate application. Fertilizer N should be placed close to the plant or band along the row; spreading application should be limited when sprinkler irrigation is used. If spread, fertilizer must be readily incorporated into the soil to avoid losses by volatilization. A sound method is distributing N through irrigation water (fertigation); this permits application of the nutrient whenever crops need it, precisely and uniformly to the wetted root volume (where the active roots are concentrated). Supplying N via foliar spray may also improve NUE, although this may involve several applications because of the low concentrations of N solution required to avoid damage. Crop selection and soil management also influence NUE. In crop rotation, deep-rooted crops should follow shallow-rooted crops. Moreover, a period of bare soil should be avoided. Phosphorus In greenhouses, P requirements for plant growth and production are relatively large compared with in open fields. Nevertheless, over-supply of P may render other nutrients insoluble and therefore unavailable for plant uptake. P uptake may be reduced by high pH in the root media. It is important to maintain media (hydroponic solutions, peat bags or other solid media) pH at 5.6–6.0 to favour P uptake. Furthermore, availability of P to plants is affected by soil temperature. For example, the uptake of P by tomato is drastically restricted at soil temperatures below 14 °C (Lingle and Davis, 1959). As a result, P deficiency may occur even in soils with adequate P levels if the soil temperature drops below 14 °C for extended periods. Table 17 gives an overview of P input and P output. To decide the P fertilizer rates, the following balance can be applied (CRPV, 2010): Eq. 7 where: Pf = P (P2O5) supplied with fertilization (kg P2O5 ha-1) Y = expected crop yield (tonnes ha-1) 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓= (𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌× 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃) ± ൫𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴× 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓_𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃൯ 10.

The chemical form of P in fertilizer materials is phosphate (H2PO4-, HPO42- or PO43-). Phosphorus is generally supplied as normal (ordinary) superphosphate (0-12-0) and triple (concentrated) superphosphate (0-46-0), both excellent sources of P which also contribute Ca. Normal superphosphate also contributes S and often Fe. Other sources are monoammonium phosphate (11-52-0), diammonium phosphate (18-46-0), monopotassium phosphate (0-52-34), or a solution product such as ammonium polyphosphate (10-34-0).

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 254 In greenhouses, all fertilizer P is usually applied preplanting, and rarely partially localized along the row at the time of planting. An effective method is to distribute soluble fertilizers through irrigation water (fertigation), enabling application of P whenever needed. The phosphate in fertilizers and manure is initially quite soluble and available. As phosphate ions enter a soil solution, most of them will react with the minerals within the soil. Phosphate ions generally react by adsorbing to soil particles or by combining with elements in the soil (Ca, Mg, Al and Fe). The adsorbed phosphate and the newly formed solids are relatively available to meet crop needs. Gradually reactions occur in which the adsorbed phosphate and the easily dissolved compounds of phosphate form more insoluble compounds that cause the phosphate to become fixed and unavailable. The conversion of available P to fixed P is partially the reason for the low efficiency of P fertilizers. Adding P to the active P pool through fertilization will also increase the amount of fixed P. On the other hand, depleting the active pool through crop uptake may cause some of the fixed P to slowly become active P. Continued application of more P than is used by the crops increases soil fertility, but much of the added P becomes fixed and unavailable. Moreover, soils differ in their phosphate-holding capacity. Another important feature is that organic matter dissolved in the soil solution competes with phosphate for binding sites on clay, counteracting P adsorption and increasing availability. Hence farming systems and rotations that bring much organic matter into soils contribute to a better use of soil and fertilizer P. Potassium Crops absorb potassium in the highest quantities (by weight) and it is for several reasons that this element needs special attention in greenhouse intensive cropping systems. As such systems are capital intensive, maximum yield and quality are required, and K is essential to both. Moreover, the demand for K fluctuates strongly according to the stage of growth, in particular for fruit vegetables. To decide K fertilizer rates, the following balance can be applied (CRPV, 2010): where: Kf = K (K2O) supplied with fertilization (kg K2O ha-1) Y = expected crop yield (tonnes ha-1) fK = the amount of K (K2O) that the crop takes up for each tonne of produce (kg K2O tonne-1 produce) KEXC = K readily available (K2O) in the soil at planting as assessed through soil analysis (kg K2O ha-1) 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓= (𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌× 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾) ± ൫𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸× 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓_𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾൯ Eq. 9 10.

This is the least expensive source of potassium and is as effective as other materials for most cropping situations, except where very high rates are required, or where the solid content of potatoes is of primary concern. When high rates of potassium are needed or when soil salinity is a problem, potassium fertilizer applications should be split or materials with a lower salt index, such as potassium sulphate (K2SO4) or potassium magnesium sulphate (K2SO4•2MgSO4), should be used. Fertigation and its management The term “fertigation” refers to the application of fertilizers with irrigation water. It involves connecting a fertilizer injector directly to the irrigation system. By adopting this approach to fertilize the crop, it is possible to supply correct levels of nutrients exactly and uniformly only to the wetted root volume, where the active roots are concentrated. This significantly increases fertilizer-use efficiency, TABLE 18 K budget of the crop: input adds K to the stock of available K in the soil; output removes K from the soil Input of K Output of K Ready available K at planting *a K in organic manures (animal manure and compost) *b K in crop residues c K with fertilizers *d Uptake by the crop *e Fixation *f Leaching g * Input-output relevant to greenhouse cropping systems. a The initial amount of exchangeable K in the soil at planting; it is measured by soil analysis. b K incorporated, e.g. with manures. c Only when the aerial part of the previous crop has been incorporated into the soil.

This not only cuts the production costs but also reduces the potential of groundwater pollution, caused by the fertilizer leaching or accumulation of nutrients and salts in the topsoil. Fertigation allows the adjustment of the amount and concentration of the applied nutrients according to the crop’s needs throughout the growing season. In order to supply nutrients to the crop effectively, the farmer must know the optimal daily nutrient consumption rate during the growing season for maximum yield and produce quality (Scaife and Bar-Yosef, 1995). Other advantages of fertigation are as follows (Imas, 2007): • Savings are made in energy and labour. • Timing of the application is flexible (nutrients can be applied to the soil when crop or soil conditions would otherwise prohibit entry into the field with conventional equipment). • It is possible to conveniently use fertilizers also containing small concentrations of micronutrients which are otherwise very difficult to apply accurately to the soil. • Nutrient supply can be regulated and monitored with precision. • Fertigation is applied through the drip irrigation system, therefore crop foliage can be kept dry thus avoiding leaf burn and delaying the development of plant pathogens. The soil texture is crucial for determining the volume of nutrient solution to distribute for each application. As a general rule (Enzo et al., 2001), in coarse soils (e.g. sandy) fertigation volume should not exceed 200 ml per plant/emitter, to avoid nutrients leaching.

The soil texture is crucial for determining the volume of nutrient solution to distribute for each application. As a general rule (Enzo et al., 2001), in coarse soils (e.g. sandy) fertigation volume should not exceed 200 ml per plant/emitter, to avoid nutrients leaching. In more fine-textured soils (e.g. clay), characterized by higher water-holding capacity and CEC, and less macroporosity, the fertigation volume should be increased to 300 ml per plant or more. In any fertigation system, the basic components are: stock tanks for fertilizers, a water source, and an efficient delivery system (including devices for mixing fertilizer and water in correct proportions, and pumps to move the nutrient solution to the plants). Most growers use fertilizer injectors for applying fertilizers to greenhouse crops. These devices “inject” a specific amount of concentrated fertilizer solution (stock solution) per increment of irrigation water that passes through the injector. An important attribute of each fertilizer injector is the TABLE 19 Recommendation of the fertigation programme for greenhouse tomato grown on sandy soil Physiological stage Concentration in the irrigation solution (ppm) N * P K Planting and establishment 120–150 40–50 180–220 Flowering 150–180 40–50 220–270 Ripening and harvest 180–200 40–50 270–300 * NH4/NO3 ration = 0.3.

Soil fertility and plant nutrition 257 injector ratio, which is defined as volumetric ratio of stock solution to dilute fertilizer solution (e.g. a 1:100 injector will deliver 100 litres of diluted fertilizer solution for each litre of concentrated stock solution that is metered through the injector). In fertigation management, it is critical to ensure that the fertilizer is formulated properly. The grower must mix the correct amount of fertilizer so that the plants receive the right concentration (ppm, mg per litre) of the various nutrients. It is preferable to use single fertilizers and to match the supply of nutrients with the crop requirement, water quality and soil conditions. Formulation with compound fertilizers often results in a mismatch with the required ratios of individual elements. It is important to have knowledge of the irrigation system established for the greenhouse: • number of emitters and their flow rate • diameter and length of main and secondary lines • residual volumes in main and secondary lines • water pressure The flow rate is the quantity of liquid dispensed through the emitters within a given time (seconds, minutes or hours). Considering a single-span greenhouse (10 × 50 m) for crops such as tomatoes, sweet peppers and cucumbers, about 12 drip lines are placed along the rows (about 0.82 m between lines). For these crops, the emitters (one emitter per plant) are spaced 0.4 m apart; therefore plant density will be around 3 plants m-2 and the greenhouse will have 1 500 emitters. With lettuce, celery or other leafy vegetables, there are 15 drip lines, spaced about 0.66 m apart, and placed between the rows (plants at about 0.33 m between rows). For these crops, the emitters (1 emitter every 2 plants) are spaced 0.3 m apart; therefore plant density will be around 10 plants m-2 and the greenhouse will have 2 500 emitters. On average, an emitter delivers 2 litres per hour, which is the daily water requirement per plant for most greenhouse crops. Therefore, if emitters are spaced 0.4 m and 0.3 m apart, the flow rate of the line will be 5.0 litres m-1 and 6.66 litres m-1, respectively. Thus, in the case of a tomato crop, the flow rate of the irrigation systems will be 3 000 litres per hour, while for lettuce 5 000 litres per hour. Growers must accurately determine the amount of fertilizer needed to mix stock solutions. Most of the manufacturers of commercial fertilizers and fertilizer injectors have produced tables that simplify this task. Information is also provided on fertilizer bags. Without recourse to tables or bags, growers can use formulae to GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 258 calculate the amount of fertilizer needed. If the rate of fertilization to apply to the crop (in ppm), the percentage of N, P and K in the fertilizers, and the injector ratio are all known, then calculations are simplified by the following formula: Eq. 11 where: A = amount of fertilizer (g) to make 1 litre of stock solution C = desired nutrient concentration (ppm) D = dilution factor (the larger number of the fertilizer injector ratio) F = % of element in fertilizer As fertilizer analysis in fertilizer bags refers to the percentage of N, P2O5 and K2O (e.g. 12-12-12 means 12% of N, 12% of P2O5 and 12% of K2O), to correctly apply the formula the percentage of P2O5 and K2O must be first converted into percentage of P and K as follows: Eq. 12 Eq. 13 Example A tomato is", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The crop is starting to flower and the farmer is adopting the fertigation programme shown in Table 19. The injector ratio is 1:100 and the farmer wants to use monopotassium phosphate (0-52-34), potassium nitrate (13- 0-46) and calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0) to supply 150 ppm (mg/litre) of N, 50 ppm of P and 220 ppm of K with each watering. The first step is to calculate how many grams of each fertilizer need to be weighed out to make 1 litre of stock solution. 1. List all the variables to find out what is known and unknown: Desired concentration in ppm = 150 N, 50 P, 220 K Injector ratio = 1:100; dilution factor = 100 Fertilizer analyses = 0-52-34, 13-0-46, 15.5-0-0 2. Convert %P2O5 to %P (Eq. 12) and K2O to %K (Eq. 13) for monopotassium phosphate, and K2O to %K for potassium nitrate: %P = 52 %P2O5/2.3 = 22.6 %P in monopotassium phosphate (0-52-34) %K = 34 %K2O/1.2 = 28.3 %K in monopotassium phosphate (0-52-34) %K = 46 %K2O/1.2 = 38.3 %K in potassium nitrate (13-0-46) 3. Calculate how much monopotassium phosphate is needed to supply 50 ppm P applying Equation 11: A = (50 ppm P × 100)/(22.6 %P × 10) = 22.1 g of 0-52-34 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴= (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶× 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷) (𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹× 10)𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ⁄ %𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃= %𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 2𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂5 2.3 ⁄ %𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾= %𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾2𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂1.2 ⁄ 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 259 4. Calculate the ppm K supplied by the amount of monopotassium phosphate determined in Step 3: (22.1 g of 0-52-34) × (28.3 %K in 0-52-34) = 6.26 g K in 0-52-34 To know the concentration (ppm) of K in nutrient solution, the farmer must convert grams to ppm and divide by the dilution factor (100): (6.26 g K × 1 000 mg litre-1)/100 = 62.6 ppm K About 63 ppm K is supplied by monopotassium phosphate. 5. Since the farmer desires 220 ppm K and monopotassium phosphate supplies only 63 ppm K, farmers must make up the rest of the K with potassium nitrate. Therefore: 220 ppm K - 63 ppm K = 157 ppm K needed from potassium nitrate 6. Determine the amount of potassium nitrate needed to supply 157 ppm K: A = (157 ppm K × 100)/(38.3% K × 10) = 41.0 g of 13-0-46 7. Calculate the ppm N supplied by the amount of potassium nitrate determined in Step 6: (41.0 g of 13-0-46) × (13% N in 13-0-46) = 5.33 g N in 13-0-46 To know the concentration (ppm) of N in nutrient solution the farmer must convert grams to ppm and divide by the dilution factor (100): (5.33 g N × 1 000 mg litre-1)/100 = 53.3 ppm N About 53 ppm N is supplied by potassium nitrate. 8. Since the farmer desires 150 ppm N and potassium nitrate supplies only 53 ppm N, farmers must make up the rest of the N with calcium nitrate. Therefore: 150 ppm N - 53 ppm N = 97 ppm N needed from calcium nitrate 9. Determine the amount of calcium nitrate needed to supply 97 ppm N: A = (97 ppm N × 100)/(15.5% N × 10) = 62.6 g of 15.5-0-0 10. Thus farmers must add 22.1 g of monopotassium phosphate (0-52- 34), 41.0 g of potassium nitrate (13-0-46), and 62.6 g of calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0) for each litre of stock solution. That means 125.7 g of fertilizer for each litre of stock solution, and 1.257 g of fertilizer for each litre of diluted nutrient solution when using a 1:100 injector. This will supply 150 ppm of N, 50 ppm of P, and 220 ppm of K with each watering.

This will supply 150 ppm of N, 50 ppm of P, and 220 ppm of K with each watering. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 260 The next questions are how much would the total volume of nutrient solution dispensed under the greenhouse be (and therefore the total volume of the stock solution), and how long would the watering last to distribute all the nutrient solution to the tomato crop? In sandy soil it is advised to distribute no more than 200 ml nutrient solution to each emitter/plant to avoid nutrient leaching. Therefore: 1. The farmer will calculate the amount of nutrient solution needed to feed 1 500 plants each watering: (200 ml nutrient solution) × (1 500 plants)/(1 000 ml litre-1) = 300 litres of nutrient solution 2. The farmer will calculate the amount of stock solution mixed by a 1:100 injector: (300 litres of nutrient solution)/100 = 3 litres of stock solution. Thus farmers must prepare 3 litres of stock solution adding 66.3 g of monopotassium phosphate (0-52-34), 123.0 g of potassium nitrate (13-0-46) and 187.8 g of calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0). This means 45.1 g of N, 15.0 g of P and 65.8 g of K. 3. Then, the farmer determines the watering time, considering that the flow rate of the irrigation system is 3 000 litres h-1: (300 litres of nutrient solution)/(3 000 litres h-1) × (60 min h-1) = 6 min In a single-span 10 × 50 m greenhouse, 6-minute fertigation with the calculated stock solution, using a 1:100 injector, is sufficient to feed the tomato crop with 45.1 g of N, 15.0 g of P and 65.8 g of K (equivalent to about 0.9 kg ha-1 N, 0.3 kg ha-1 P and 1.3 kg ha-1 K). The farmer must check if these match the daily consumption rate of tomato at its physiological stage. If not, the application must be repeated during the day. During the crop cycle, especially for short-term crops like bedding plants, it is important that the farmer measures the electrical conductivity (EC) of the fertilizer solution on a weekly basis to check that the injector is working properly. 10. Soil fertility and plant nutrition 261 FIGURE 3 N fertilizer requirements GAP recommendations Cropping systems and fertilizer recommendations differ between regions but some general rules are valid: • Plant nutrients are absorbed by the roots and eventually assimilated in order to sustain plant metabolism and growth. • Seasonal variation in nutrient requirements depends on crop ontogeny. Nutrient uptake ratios change according to developmental stage as a result of variation in the growth rate of different plant organs, which have different mineral compositions. • The rate of mineral uptake is related to the rate of crop growth and tends to decline with plant age, as does the critical nutrient concentration of plant tissues. • Soil N-P-K supply derives from the mineralization of old organic matter and the addition of fresh material (e.g. crop residues, organic manure). Therefore fertilizer recommendation systems need to estimate this input.

Therefore: Estimation of the crop’s nutrient requirement is very important for both economic and environmental reasons. Thus: • Knowledge of expected crop yield is crucial to estimate total nutrient requirements and avoid overfertilization. • Knowledge of actual crop water uptake (or transpiration) may provide a useful tool for real- time estimation of crop growth and, hence, nutrient requirements. • Prevention of nutrition imbalance is important: visually monitor crop mineral status day- by-day and analyse, at regular intervals, soil and leaf tissues and, in soilless culture, growing medium and nutrient solution. • Soil mineral status at the start of the growing season is a good starting point for fertilizer recommendations. • Soil tests, carried out before planting, provide an estimate of the amount of fertilizer to be applied; plant analyses can then be used to monitor crop nutritional status throughout the growing season, allowing adjustment for errors in fertilization. • For assessment of soil nutrient concentration, follow specific sampling procedures for both pattern of sampling and sample size to give adequate spatial coverage. • For assessment of plant nutrient concentration, follow standard recommended procedures for sampling whole plant or plant parts. Collect the right plant part at the right time (within the day or the growing season) for the specific nutrient to be assessed. Consider: • Splitting the supply of fertilizers throughout the growing season greatly increases the opportunity to match total supply to actual requirement for fertilizer, lessens the nutrient loss from agricultural land, and reduces risk of soil salinization. It is therefore crucial to enhance the efficiency of fertilizer applications: • Apply at least part of the fertilizers during crop growth in accordance with crop nutritional status. • Apply fertilizers via fertigation. 10.

Residues can be a danger to human health (for both consumers and producers) and often lead to environmental pollution. Several techniques have been introduced to the region to overcome such problems with minimum negative impact on the environment and human health: soil fumigation using solar energy, use of grafted seedlings and soilless culture. This chapter examines growing media used in soilless culture; they represent one of the main solutions for soil problems, have positive effects on the environment and improve fertilizer and water-use efficiency. This is especially the case in Mediterranean countries where shortage of good quality water is a major constraint in protected cultivation. At present, a relatively small proportion (approximately 10%) of growing media – which are very important for a good start to plant cultivation – can be used for the production of seedlings and transplants. The cultivation of plants in systems without soil in situ is defined in literature as “soilless culture” (Gruda, 2009). Many such systems are based on the use of solid rooting media for growing plants. They are usually called “growing media” or “substrates”; however, sometimes terms like “aggregate systems”, “supporting media” or “potting soil” are used.

With reference to plant cultivation and propagation, “growing media” or “substrates” are defined as all those solid materials, other than soil, which alone or in mixtures can guarantee better conditions than agricultural soil (for one or more aspects). Hence, media of different origin take on the role of soil and provide anchorage for the root system, supply water and nutrients for the plant, and guarantee adequate aeration in the root area (Gruda et al., 2006). GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 272 Growing media are used in containers (organic substrates, perlite etc.). However, sometimes they are used in the form of prepared cubes (rockwool cubes for seedling and transplant production), bags and slabs (peat-based substrates and rockwool, respectively), mats (polyurethane foam) and troughs (rockwool); these last three are also used for vegetable production in soilless culture systems. While development is very country related, from a historical point of view the development of growing media can be expressed in distinct steps (Gruda, 2012a): • Until the 1950s, horticulturists used gardening soil – mixtures of own composted organic waste and mineral soil, used both for plants with bare roots and for plants with root balls. • In the 1950s, peat culture substrates, mixed with clay or alone, were developed. These substrates became established in the 1960s and peat became the main component of growing media. • In the mid- to late 1970s, rockwool substrate spread throughout Western Europe and became important for vegetable cultivation. Tomatoes, cucumbers and bell peppers were grown in rockwool slabs, wrapped in plastic film. Rockwool is still one of the most popular growing media in vegetable soilless culture. • In the 1980s and 1990s, specific mixtures for specific plants were produced from peat – the ease of rockwool cubes and slabs was combined with good growing properties. The development and refinement of growing media in horticulture in the 1980s and 1990s coincided with increased ecological awareness. In recent years, many innovative cultivation procedures using new growing media methods have been developed, including systems without a solid medium, as well as aggregate systems in which inorganic or organic substrates are used (Gruda, 2009). Different materials can be used as growing media offering numerous advantages: Compared with water culture and aeroponics: • reservoir for water and plant nutrients • adequate oxygen exchange • anchorage or support for plant • lower rhizosphere temperature excursion Compared with natural soil culture: • standardization • light weight • virtual absence of pests • cultivation without soil 11. Growing media 273 There are also disadvantages compared with on-soil cultivation: • volume limitation • balanced fertilizer ratios requirement • potential expense • rapid development of deficiency symptoms CHARACTERISTICS OF GROWING MEDIA When choosing a growing medium, knowledge of its characteristics (physical, chemical and biological) is very important, because they affect plant response and production cost. Absence of pests and pathogens is essential; biostability and biological inertia are other parameters to be taken into consideration, particularly when long cycles are carried out or the growing medium is reused during successive growing cycles. There are different national and international standard methods used for the investigation of substrates. In order to simplify international information exchange, the ISHS (International Society for Horticultural Science) method is suggested as a standard. Physical properties The physical properties of substrates give important information concerning numerous parameters, for example: water/air ratio (required for proper regulation of irrigation); and volume weight or bulk density. On the basis of such parameters, it is possible to make further calculations of the substrate’s mineral content (Gruda and Schnitzler, 1999a; Gruda and Schnitzler, 2004a). Furthermore, it is important to know water distribution and movement at root level. The fact that growers cannot affect a target change of the physical characteristics of substrates or substrate mixtures within a culture means that it is essential to select the correct substrate before cultivation starts (Verdonck and Demeyer, 2004). Given that the volume of growing media in the containers is relatively small, the requirements regarding a substrate’s physical properties and their standardization are very high.

Given that the volume of growing media in the containers is relatively small, the requirements regarding a substrate’s physical properties and their standardization are very high. Besides the standard ISHS method, the negative or positive pressure method (mostly used for the investigation of water content in mineral soils) can also be used for the investigation of a substrate’s physical properties. Gruda and Schnitzler (1999a) found close relationships between the modified ISHS method and the two other methods at pF = 1.0, 1.7 and 2.0. Other methods are used as industrial standards in certain countries, for example, CEN (European Committee for Standardization) in the EU region. Volume weight or bulk density (g/cc) Dry mass per unit volume is related to discrete mineral particles and to amorphous compounds, the latter represented by organic matter. As some media are composed GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 274 of more than one ingredient, the characteristics of each ingredient contribute to the total of volume weight of the medium (Raviv et al., 2002). Moreover, the quantity of organic substrate in a container (in some degree inorganic as well) can be affected by substrate compression. Different volume weight can lead to different physical properties as well as to diverse nutrient levels in the substrate. Therefore it is recommended to determine the volume weight on the basis of real container/pot conditions (Gruda and Schnitzler, 1999a). Although it depends on origin and grain size, the average volume weight of peat materials is 0.09–0.20 g cm-3 (RAL, 1999). However, the requirements in relation to volume weight and substrates for containerized horticultural plants, e.g. for transplant production, depend on the production system and technology adopted. Volume weight affects the choice of substrates in various ways. For example, to prevent container instability in windy conditions, high volume weight media are required, while for frequently irrigated high intensity greenhouse crops, media of low volume weight are required (Raviv et al., 2002; Wallach, 2008). Low volume weight is also important when transporting growing media. Particle size The array of particles can be divided into groups according to size, and the medium solid phase as a whole can be characterized in terms of the relative proportions of its particle size groups. The size and shape of particle size distribution are useful for estimating the hydraulic properties of the media, such as water retention and hydraulic conductivity (Wallach, 2008). Gruda and Schnitzler (2006) observed a close relationship between the amount of solid particles < 1 mm and the water-holding capacity of substrates. For example, for a fine wood fibre substrate used as a component for production of press pots for vegetable seedlings, the maximum water capacity with 100 percent of particles < 1 mm was about 95 percent, while a complete absence of these particle sizes resulted in maximum water capacity of 70 percent. Therefore, it is possible to control the maximum water capacity by the quantity of fine particles. Porosity A growing medium, like soil, consists of three phases: solid, aqueous and gaseous. The pores are filled with air or water according to pore dimension and water content in the substrate. Although the porosity or total pore space (TPS) does not account for pore size distribution or water and air content in the pores, it is often used when characterizing substrates. The TPS of substrates is higher than in soils, where it is approximately 50 percent of the volume. De Boodt and Verdonck (1972) and Fonteno et al. (1981) point out that an ideal substrate should have a TPS of over 85 percent. In general, depending on shape, arrangement and particle size, organic substrate TPS is about 85–95 percent (Michiels et al., 1993), while other growing media contain 60–90 percent (Raviv at al., 2002). Analyses 11. Growing media 275 generally result in negative correlation of porosity and volume weight of growing media. However, the volume weight cannot accurately determine TPS if components with closed pores, such as perlite, pumice or expanded clay, are used (Bunt, 1976; Wallach, 2008).

Plate 1 shows the closed porosity of an expanded clay granule after breakage. Water and air ratio and pore size distribution Water and air volume are the most important physical parameters for substrates (Bunt, 1976). Water must be available in the substrate at the lowest possible energy status while maintaining sufficient air supply in the root zone. The two parameters are antagonistic: if the pores are filled with water, air is missing and vice versa (De Boodt et al., 1974). The volume of water that saturates a given volume of substrate is defined as its effective pore space (EPS) or air volume. The difference between TPS and EPS constitutes the volume of closed pores that are not accessible by water (Raviv et al., 2002). Container capacity (also known as “water-holding capacity”) is the amount of water remaining in the container after water stops draining following saturation. The water content for growing media is usually defined at water suction of 1 kPa or at pF = 1.0. Water-holding capacity is one of the most important aspects to consider in irrigation frequency and volume management. However, within the same growing media, a given volume can hold a different amount of water when gravitational water stops draining. While “container capacity” and “water-holding capacity” are sometimes used as synonyms, container capacity is the total volume of water in the container, and water-holding capacity is the water content at pF = 1.0 (Gruda, 2005). Higher containers signify a higher water column (Fonteno et al., 1981; Karlovich and Fonteno, 1986; Martinez et al., 1991; Milks et al., 1989; Gruda and Schnitzler, 2004a). Therefore, relatively less water is held by capillarity and adhesive forces and more water is drained by gravity (Gruda and Schnitzler, 2006). The upper layers of the substrate hold a lower amount of water, while potential water availability is much higher at the container bottom (Figure 1). Gravitational force is higher in the upper part of the substrate; consequently, the water-holding capacity is lower in taller containers. Taller cells or containers have a larger percentage of TPS space, even if the same growing media or substrate mix is used. Plate 1 Expanded clay closed porosity GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 276 Therefore, when considering a different water-holding capacity in relation to container shape and height, it is generally better to speak of container capacity rather than field capacity. To this end, the container zoning concept (accounting for moisture characteristics and container geometry) is introduced to quantify the water-holding capacity. One criterion for substrate classification is the quantity of free water that can be delivered to the plant roots at different water potential levels. However, not all the water in the growing media is available to the plant. According to Figure 1, the following types of water can be found in the substrate: • Gravitational water (number 1 in Figure 1) – not held in the substrate and moves in response to gravity (the amount of free water in the pF range 1.0–2.0 [-1–-10 kPa] is an important parameter for substrate cultures). • Easily available water (EAW) (number 2) – directly available to plants (the amount of free water when pF increases from 1.0 to 1.7 [-1–-5 kPa], it fills pores of 60–300 µm). • Water-buffering capacity (WBC) (number 3) – serves as a reserve, when the plants transpire intensively (De Boodt and Verdonck, 1972) (the amount of free water when pF increases from 1.7 to 2.0 [-5–-10 kPa], it fills pores of 30–60 µm).

Large pores generally favour rapid drainage and adequate aeration for plants, while water is mainly held in small pores. Therefore, adequate pore size and distribution are critical for a good medium. However, other factors also have an impact. In wood fibre substrates, the pore size distribution of a growing medium is not only influenced by substrate type, but also by particle size, substrate compression (and consequently real volume weight), container size and height, volume loss during a growth cycle, and plant growth and root development (Gruda and Schnitzler, 2004a). Hydraulic conductivity (cc/min) The saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of a substrate is an indicator of drainage behaviour, also referred to as permeability, permeability factor, flowing rate and filter rate. Drainage behaviour is mainly defined by the percentage of macropores. Higher Ksat implies a higher percentage of macropores, while destruction of these pores leads to decreased Ksat (Gruda and Schnitzler, 2004a). According to Raviv et al. (2002) particles of smaller-sized individual grains have a larger specific surface area, increasing the drag on water molecules that flow through the medium. Therefore water flows off fastest in coarse growing media, followed by substrates and mixtures with smaller-sized particles. What is more, in growing media with higher hydraulic conductivity, the water/ nutrient solution passes more through the central part of the substrate near to the irrigation dripper and progressively less through the part of the substrate located closer to the container walls (Figure 2). This uneven distribution of nutrient solution in the substrate, apart from affecting the uptake of nutrients and water, can determine variations in electrical conductivity and pH in different parts of the rhizosphere. Furthermore, as micropores increase, so does pore continuity. This can be documented through the pore tortuosity. Pore tortuosity represents a fitting factor and is linked to the fact that some of the pores are clogged up and that the real pathway for waterflow is longer than FIGURE 2 Nutrient solution distribution in perlite (% referred to the total) in relation to the distance from dripper projection Leonardi et al., 2001 - 6 - 4 - 2 0 2 4 6 Distance from dripper (cm) 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 (%) < > GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 278 the apparent one (Caron and Nkongolo, 2004). For peat substrate, the pore tortuosity was found to be closely correlated with the plant growth of Prunus × cistena sp. (Allaire et al., 1996). Changes in tortuosity can also result from sample disturbances. Thermal characteristics are mainly related to thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. It is important to know the possible effects of these characteristics on growing media and consequently on root temperature; they should be considered in relation to the water-holding capacity of the substrate, which in turn affects the apparent specific heat (cal C-1 cm-3). Chemical properties For the evaluation of the chemical properties of a growing medium, the most important criteria are pH value, cation exchange capacity (CEC), salt concentration and nutrient content (macro- and microelements). pH value pH plays an important role in plant substrates, determining the availability of various nutrients. Although plant pH requirements differ, for most plants optimal nutrient availability occurs when the pH value of a nutrient solution is between 5.5 and 6.5. Higher values, even pH > 6.0, nearly always reduce the solubility of phosphates, iron and most micronutrients. Moreover, high pH values (> 7.5) in the irrigation water are undesirable, given the probable precipitation of Ca and Mg carbonates, as well as orthophosphates, which can clog the drippers. The pH value of the nutrient solution can also be important for the interaction between orthophosphate ions and solid constituents. Thus, low P availability may restrict crop productivity even shortly after P application (Raviv", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The pH value of the nutrient solution can also be important for the interaction between orthophosphate ions and solid constituents. Thus, low P availability may restrict crop productivity even shortly after P application (Raviv et al., 2002). Significant variations in pH can occur for some substrates, depending on their provenance (Table 1). Therefore, correction may be advisable, taking into account the different reactions of the considered substrates (Figure 3). TABLE 1 pH value of different substrates Substrate pH value Expanded clay 4.5–9.0 Peat 3.0–7.3 Perlite 6.5–7.5 Pumice 6.7–9.3 Sand 6.4–7.9 Vermiculite 6.0–7.2 Volcanic tuff 7.0–8.0 Gianquinto and Pimpini, 2001 FIGURE 3 pH variations of peat one week after adding different amounts of calcium carbonate to the substrate Fisher, 1985 pH 7 6 5 4 3 0 3 6 9 12 g/l Light peat Dark peat 11. Growing media 279 In general, lower pH value and lower nutrient and salt content are better for substrate preparation and production. Initial materials with such characteristics (e.g. peat moss) permit substrate manufacture where: • the pH value can be increased easily by lime addition; • it is possible to regulate and balance the relatively high pH value of other component materials; and • the demands or requirements of different cultures can be accurately taken into account, produced and controlled (Gruda, 2005). Furthermore, it should be considered that pH values for some organic growing media (e.g. pine tree substrates) change during the storage process (Jackson et al., 2009). It is therefore recommended to analyse the substrates immediately before plant cultivation and if necessary to adjust the pH value for optimal plant growth. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) CEC gives information about the sorption force and buffering ability of a substrate for nutrients. Substrates with high CEC can store more nutrients and plants are fertilized more intensively. In addition, such substrates buffer the fertilizer or mineral materials better when hard water is used (Gruda, 2005). CEC is considered an important substrate characteristic when nutrient solution is not continuously offered and solid fertilizers are used. The growing media composition is important; continuous fertigation of on-substrate-grown crops enables the use of different substrates with different CEC. For example, the CEC of growing media can be very low (CEC ~1.5–3.5 meq/100 g, e.g. perlite) or high (CEC ~100–180 meq/100 g, e.g. sphagnum peat). However, even inert substrate accumulates organic compounds (e.g. plant roots or decomposed materials during the growth process) which can build up surface charge. From a practical point of view, considering the small volumes of growing media used for vegetable production, high CEC growing media also lead to limited nutrient-buffering capacity; however, frequent fertigation can mitigate the negative effects. Salt concentration Growing media can sometimes have a relatively high salt concentration, for example, when the organic or mineral materials used as a substrate are collected from an area with significant salt sources (e.g. close to the sea). In these cases, excess salt leaching is required prior to substrate use. Excess salt concentration can also be observed in organic substrates when high rate organic matter decomposition occurs. In most situations, the rate of release of mineral salts is about the same as the rate of uptake by the plants. Therefore, there is no excessive build-up (Handreck and Black, 2005). However, when materials GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 280 that decompose easily are adopted, problems can be observed. In vegetable production the risk is not so frequent because the seedling production period is too short to determine such an effect, and in soilless cultivation it is not advisable to adopt unstable organic substrates, because decomposition would correspond to outstanding variation of substrate physical characteristics. Biological properties A good growing media must be free from pests and pathogens, biologically stable and not toxic. Phytotoxicity The use of forestry products (bark, sawdust, woodchips) as well as compost container substrates can involve problems of phytotoxicity. Phytotoxicity depends on the chemical composition of the substrate, which in turn can cause salinity, nutritional disorders and enzymatic or hormonal metabolic alterations (Ortega et al., 1996).

Phytotoxicity depends on the chemical composition of the substrate, which in turn can cause salinity, nutritional disorders and enzymatic or hormonal metabolic alterations (Ortega et al., 1996). High potassium and manganese content (Maher and Thomson, 1991) and the presence of phenolic compounds (Ortega et al., 1996), terpenes, organic acids and fatty acids (Morel and Guillemain, 2004) can be the cause of such problems (Gruda et al., 2009). Gruda and Schnitzler (2004b) report no plant growth inhibition when bark content in fresh pine or spruce wood fibre substrate is approximately 5 percent. On the contrary, a higher amount of fresh bark negatively affects plant growth. Using hardwood sawdust as a growing medium, it was found that the wood contained phytotoxins, which in return affected plant growth (Maas and Adamson, 1982). Indeed, these compounds have a protection effect and defend woods against insects or infections; therefore, they are toxic to other organisms, such as greenhouse plants cultivated in substrates originating from those materials (Gruda et al., 2009). Methods such as composting, ageing, leaching, washing, mixing and fertilization have been used to reduce or eliminate phytotoxicity properties (Ortega et al., 1996; Gruda et al., 2000). Gruda et al. (2009) reported that extracts from pine tree substrates produced by grinding loblolly pine tree (Pinus taeda L.) reduced the germination rate and radicle growth of tomato and lettuce; however, after washing, an improvement was recorded for radicle length of both species. Pre-treatments (e.g. substrate washing) can be recommended for use in the manufacturing process for pine tree substrates or by growers before planting. Several authors have reported that the growth of fungi on woody tissues in solid-state fermentations on pine chip fermentations decreased toxicity (Dorado et al., 2000; Linares et al., 2003). 11. Growing media 281 N-immobilization The transfer of inorganic N-compounds into micro-organism bodies through nitrogen consumption and their reservation is known as N-immobilization. Net N-immobilization occurs in organic materials because of the wide range of C/N ratio, for example: in waste paper 135 : 1, in straw 50–100 : 1, in crusts 75–117 : 1, and in wood fibre substrates 100–272 : 1 (Gruda et al., 2000). Optimal plant growth is ensured only if sufficient nitrogen is available for both micro-organisms and plants (Handreck, 1992); different solutions have been developed for reducing N-immobilization. Composting makes it possible to use waste bark or wood as a substrate; while this process stabilizes the organic substances, it takes a long time and can lead to loss of raw material (Handreck, 1992; Prasad, 1997b). Other methods involve adding supplemental substances to substrates to eliminate the “weaknesses” of natural wooden materials: for example, hydrolysis of woodchips under pressure in the presence of acids (Lemaire et al., 1989). Using this method, the lignin-cellulose ratio in wood changes from 1 : 2–3 to 1 : 1–2. The supply of nitrogen and other mineral additives prior to manufacturing fibre substrates under high pressure and heat in the presence of water vapour, in order to improve substrate properties, is called “impregnation” (Penningsfeld, 1992). GROWING MEDIA CLASSIFICATION AND CHOICE Numerous plant substrates are used in various types of soilless culture systems. Moreover, new materials have been introduced worldwide. The international trend for substrate development tends towards the use of natural resources and renewable raw materials (Gruda, 2005). Given their diversity, the classification of growing media helps growers make the right choice. Growing media are generally classified into organic and inorganic materials. Inorganic substrates can come from natural sources as well as processed materials; organic growing media can be synthetic (e.g. polyurethane) or natural organic matter (e.g. peat, wood-based substrates). Growing media can also be classified as fibrous (e.g. coir) and granular (e.g. perlite). Bearing in mind that important properties of growing media include their chemical characteristics, they can also be classified as active (e.g. peat) or inert (e.g. rockwool and sand). Herein is described the classification into organic and inorganic materials. The choice of a substrate for soilless cultivation has technical and financial implications.

There is no univocal scheme for the choice of growing media. In several areas where on-substrate cultivation is exploited, growers try to adopt local factory-manufactured products, or locally available cheap substrates, even when there is insufficient information about their physical and chemical characteristics and, consequently, their management. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 282 The choice of a given growing medium without standardization does not guarantee correct nutrient solution management, given the more or less notable differences in substrate typology, provenance and batch. For a correct choice of growing media, some desirable properties should be considered, but it is rare to find growing media with all these properties, and in some cases pH correction, disinfection or substrate mixing is advisable to achieve the desired properties. Growing media mixtures are generally used in vegetable soilless greenhouses and in the seedling and transplant industry; they consist of growing media constituents and additives. Growing media constituents include a range of raw materials; general combinations include peat and other organic or inorganic materials and are formulated on a percentage volume basis. Growing media additives include fertilizers, liming materials, biocontrol or wetting agents, and are formulated on a weight basis. It is recommended to use finished products, not to experiment with self-produced mixtures. Furthermore, the above properties assume importance according to the growing system adopted. Continuously fertigated crops do not necessarily require growing media with a high cation exchange capacity, compared with potted plants and containerized crops. For closed systems (comparison with open systems), a Choosing a substrate Desirable properties: • Low volume weight • Good reserve of easily available water and good aeration • Good rehydration properties after drying • Stable structure • Good buffering capacity for an optimal pH • Appropriate pH properties for the crop • Uniform from batch to batch • Free of phytotoxic compounds • Low micro-organism activity • Pest- and pathogen-free Aspects to be considered: • Availability of information on chemical and physical characteristics • Type of soilless system adopted • Shape and volume of the container • Reusability • Costs 11. Growing media 283 low water-holding capacity does not represent a problem, as it is possible to adopt frequent irrigation without loss of leached nutrient solution which is recycled. Moreover, for subirrigated crops, the suitability of the substrate in allowing capillary rise is very important for an appropriate distribution of nutrient solution in the growing media. In addition, other aspects related to the availability of water and electric power should also be taken into consideration; for example a blackout of a few hours (frequent in country areas) may prove particularly dangerous when a substrate with a low holding capacity is used. Inorganic growing media Besides rockwool, various inorganic substrates, such as perlite, tuff (a volcanic porous rock), expanded clay granules and vermiculite, as well as synthetic materials, have been used as growing media (Gruda et al., 2006). While in older installations, mainly gravel and sand were applied to improve aeration, nowadays lighter materials (e.g. rockwool, originally produced for thermal and acoustic insulation in the construction industry) are widely used (Raviv et al., 2002; Gruda et al., 2006). Rockwool Polythene-wrapped rockwool, thanks to its light weight and ease of handling, has become the dominant soilless culture system in Europe and is used throughout the world for both flowers and vegetables, e.g. tomatoes (Plate 2) (Gruda et al., 2006). In addition, cubes or blocks of different sizes are used for seedling and transplant propagation and granulated rockwool is used as a component of potting mixtures. Rockwool is manufactured by melting basaltic rock with limestone and coke at high temperatures and spinning the melt into fibres. Afterwards the fibres are bound together by heating them with additives. Rockwool has a low volume weight of approximately 0.07–0.1 g cm-3 and a TPS of 92–97 percent. The main chemical characteristic of rockwool is that it is totally inert, except for some minor effects on pH. The initial pH of the material is rather high (7.0–8.0) and a pH adjustment is therefore required (Smith, 1987).

The main chemical characteristic of rockwool is that it is totally inert, except for some minor effects on pH. The initial pH of the material is rather high (7.0–8.0) and a pH adjustment is therefore required (Smith, 1987). Generally, the setup of a rockwool growing system is simple: rockwool slabs are placed in the rows, holes for plants are cut in the plastic surrounding the slabs, and the slabs are filled with Plate 2 Greenhouse tomato plants, cultivated in rockwool slabs GRUDA, 2010 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 284 solution. After soaking for about 24 hours, the transplants are placed on the slabs with drainage slits cut at the bottom. A complete nutrient solution is supplied to the rockwool cubes through the irrigation system. The key factor in managing the system is the management of the pH and EC (electrical conductivity) in the slab. Therefore samples of the nutrient solution from the slabs should be analysed periodically; at least once a month the nutrient solution should be analysed and, if necessary, the nutrient solution and frequency and time of irrigation adjusted. Perlite The use of perlite provides improved aeration and drainage and optimum moisture retention and nutrient availability. Perlite is not a trade name but the term used for naturally occurring siliceous volcanic mineral sieved and heated to 1000 °C. At these temperatures perlite expands to 4–20 times its original volume, due to the presence of 2–6 percent combined water in the perlite rock, producing a lightweight material with high porosity. Perlite can be used alone or mixed with other substrates for greenhouse plant production. It is a well-established substrate in Europe. The Mediterranean region has seen a rapid expansion of perlite soilless culture systems (growbags), pioneered by Spain, where they are used extensively, mainly for vegetable productions in the Almería and Murcia regions (Grillas et al., 2001). There is a similar growth pattern (albeit on a smaller scale) observed in other parts of the Mediterranean, for example in Greece and North African countries. The high porosity helps to control the water-holding capacity and aeration of the substrate (Grillas et al., 2001). Vermiculite Similarly to perlite, vermiculite is produced by heating the ground and sieved material to 700–1 000 °C. Vermiculite is sterile, light in weight and has a high TPS. Its volume weight is 0.1 g cm-3. Vermiculite is used as a sowing medium, covering germinating seeds, and as a component of potting soil mixtures. Media containing vermiculite should be mixed dry; when mixed wet, the desirable physical properties deteriorate because particles tend to collapse flat (Handreck and Black, 2005). While perlite is mainly used to improve the drainage properties in a mix, vermiculite is used to increase the water-holding capacity of a growing medium. It can hold 3–4 times its weight of water. Furthermore, vermiculite can hold positive-charged nutrients such as K, Mg and Ca. Zeolite Zeolites are silicate mineral with extremely high exchange capacities. The many different zeolites found around the world vary considerably in hardness and in the proportions of cations they contain (Handreck and Black, 2005). Zeolites possess a relatively high volume weight (1.9–2.3 g cm-3) and are therefore used in substrate mixtures; however, they are also used as single growing media. In a study with tomatoes, Savvas et al. (2004) reported highest yields when plants were grown in zeolite, followed by treatment involving zeolite in a substrate mixture. 11. Growing media 285 The good performance of the plants grown in zeolite was due to the considerable cation exchange capacity, enabling a more efficient buffering of excess ammonium and Mg concentrations in the root environment. Moreover, zeolite was capable of absorbing part of the excess Mg, resulting in more balanced macronutrient cation ratios in the root environment. On the other hand, during the initial wetting of the substrates with nutrient solution, most of the K was absorbed on the surface of the zeolite; as a result, the K concentration was sharply reduced in the solutions drained from substrates with constituents comprising zeolite. Using zeolite in sand mixtures offers potential in countries where sand is abundant (Al-Ajmi et al., 2009).", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Zeolite has also been reported to protect plants against toxicity (e.g. from ammonium – Handreck and Black, 2005) or from heavy metals (Kapetanios and Loizidou, 1992). Pumice Pumice is a natural product, a light silicate mineral of volcanic origin. It is used as substrate for fruit vegetables (tomato, cucumber, pepper) and for cut flowers. There is increased interest in growing plants in pumice, because it requires relatively low Plate 3 Materials used as growing media From left to right and top to bottom: rockwool, polyurethane foam, expanded shale, volcanic material, open porous clay granulate, expanded clay, perlite, black peat, coarse wood fibre, fine wood fibre, vermiculite, and light peat GRUDA ET AL., 2006 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 286 investments and is easily applicable in existing growing systems. Pumice can be used for many years, so it produces relatively little substrate waste. In addition, pumice is friendly to the environment, because no harmful production processes are involved (Boertje, 1995). Pumice is common in areas rich in volcanic activity, such as the Portuguese Azores, the Greek islands, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Sicily, Turkey and the United States (Raviv et al., 2002). High transport costs limit its use in areas that do not have local deposits. Pumice has a low volume weight of 0.4–0.8 g cm-3 and a TPS of 70–85 percent (Boertje, 1995). Pumice has a neutral pH; it contributes little to plant nutrition, but does not decrease the availability of fertilizer nutrients (Handreck and Black, 2005). Sand Many grades of sand are available and can be used as a growing medium or as a component of various substrate mixtures in order to improve the drainage properties. Pure sand is widely used in deserts and coastal plains, because it is a cheap, local, natural source. The volume weight of sand is 1.48–1.80 g cm-3 and the TPS is relatively low at 0.30–0.45 (Raviv et al., 2002). In Almería, beach sand is used as mulch on a stratified, artificial soil profile: manure is placed in strips, about 1 m wide and 2 cm deep, between the sand and the 20 cm of loam or clay soil placed on top of the original, rocky, sandy loam soil (Castilla et al., 1986). According to the author, the use of sandy mulch soil in greenhouse crop production reduces loss through evaporation and allows the use of more saline water without reducing the harvest. Tuff Tuff is the common name for volcanic material used as a growing medium for greenhouse crops in several countries around the world. It has a TPS of 60–80% and a high surface area. The volume weight of tuff is 0.8–1.5 g cm-3. Rapid cooling of magma during eruption prevents the formation of primary minerals and, therefore, pyroclastic materials contain mainly vesicular, volcanic glass. The physical and chemical properties of tuff are determined mainly by its mineralogical composition and weathering stages, as well as the grinding and sieving processes (Raviv et al., 2002). Tuffs possess a buffering capacity and may absorb or release nutrients, especially P, during the growth period (Raviv et al., 2002). Expanded clay granules Expanded clay is a granular product with a cellular structure. It is produced by heating dry, heavy clay to 1100 °C: water is released, causing the clay to expand. The raw material must have a low content of soluble salts to avoid having to add substances, such as lime, during the process. Expanded clays are light with a low volume weight of 0.28–0.63 g cm-3; chemically, they are neutral, with a pH of about 7.0 (Raviv et al., 2002). While expanded clays are used primarily for indoor plants in offices, they are also used for different greenhouse hydroponic cultures (Cervelli and Farina, 1994; Schnitzler et al., 1994; Dobricevic et al., 2008). 11.

Growing media 287 Organic growing media The organic materials most available and applicable are peat, composts, bark and wood residues. However, availability alone is not sufficient: a substrate should be a standardized and growth-promoting product (Gruda, 2005). The organic substrates most used are described below. Peat Peat is the most widely used growing media and substrate component in horticulture, currently accounting for 77–80 percent of the growing media used annually in Europe’s horticultural industry (Gruda, 2012a). Seedlings and transplants are grown predominantly in organic substrates based on peat (Plate 4); it is also used in horticulture as a raw material for substrates in which container plants are grown (Gruda, 2005). Peat has long been used as a component of standardized growing media; however, research in the 1960s showed that it could be used as a growing medium in its own right both for container plants and for vegetable and cut flower production (Puustjarvi, 1973). Peat substrates offer numerous advantages and their nutrient content and pH are easy to control because both are initially low. Peat is formed as a result of the partial decomposition of sphagnum, other mosses and sedges. Under cool waterlogged conditions, sugar and celluloses decompose, leaving behind the lignified cell walls and humus. Different types of peat vary in their degree of decomposition (Handreck and Black, 2005). Plant species, climate and water quality all affect the distinct characteristics of peat (Raviv et al., 2002). Plate 4 Peat-based growing media, used in press pot industry for production of lettuce seedlings GRUDA., 2006 Advantages of peat as a growing medium • Relative consistency • Low nutrient content • Low pH • Light weight • High volume of pores • Good air capacity • High water-holding capacity • High CEC • General freedom from pollutants, pathogens and seeds of weeds • Stable structure • Ease of storage • Possibilities for reuse or recycling Gruda, 2005; Gruda et al., 2006 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 288 Von Post (1937) suggested a classification of peat types, based on their degree of decomposition: light peat, dark peat and black peat (Table 2). The higher the degree of composition, the higher the pH value of the peat. For example, sphagnum peat has a very low degree of composition and an acidic pH of 3–4: it may be directly applied to acid-loving plants; alternatively, the pH may be adjusted using dolomite lime. Peat is a very porous substrate with an excellent water-holding capacity; it is therefore used together with other growing media to increase the water mixture properties and reduce the weight of the mix for long distance transportation. Potential constraints are the instability, slumping and shrinkage of peat that can occur in container culture (Plate 5). Nevertheless, finding a replacement for peat as a horticultural substrate is an increasingly pressing issue. Peat-substitute growing media or alternatives to peat The increased environmental awareness of consumers, the constant dismantling of ecologically important peat bog areas, and the pervasive waste problem all force the horticulture industry to re-examine its practices (Gruda, 2005; Gruda, 2012b). Numerous plant substrates have been introduced worldwide as peat substitutes or as peat-alternative growing media.

Gianquinto and Pimpini, 2001 Plate 5 Shrinkage of peat substrate in container GRUDA, 2012 11. Growing media 289 manufactured from organic matter by heating in an anoxic situation (pyrolysis), has been used in agriculture and introduced into horticulture as a growing medium. Different materials, including coir, sawdust and woodchips, as well as cheap locally available sources, such as straw and organic waste can be used for its production. Converting organic waste into biochar by heating organic material produces a standardized medium, with high stability, less volume weight, and good aeration and water-holding characteristics. Biochar can absorb phytotoxic compounds, is not easily available for micro-organisms, and has the advantage of being carbon neutral (Nichols and Savidov, 2010). Different experiments with different vegetables have been conducted, but to the authors’ knowledge, biochar has not been commercially used in soilless Mediterranean greenhouses to date. Alternatives to peat used as growing media in the horticultural industry are described below. Coir (coconut fibre) Coir is used mainly in the greenhouse industry. The raw material, which looks like sphagnum peat but coarser, is derived from the husk of the coconut fruit commercially grown in, for example, Sri Lanka, India, the Philippines and Latin America. Coir has good aeration and water-holding characteristics. Coir dust has a TPS (total pore space) of 86–94% and an AFP (air-filled pore space) of 9–14%, while coir fibre has a TPS of 98% and an AFP of around 70% (Raviv et al., 2002). According to Prasad (1997a), coir dust is characterized by a relatively high EAW (easily available water) of around 35%. However, the water-buffering capacity is lower in coir than in peat, and the level of air space varies considerably depending on the origin of the material. Leaching of nitrogen is marginally higher in coir than in peat when comparing materials of similar particle size. On the other hand, CO2 evolution and stability indicate that coir is less stable than Irish peat (Prasad, 1997a) and the total water-holding capacity in coir waste is lower than in peat (Noguera et al., 2000). Sometimes higher total soluble salts, sodium and chloride levels are found in coir: Noguera et al. (2000) investigated 13 coconut coir wastes commercially produced in six countries in Africa, America and Asia and found salinity varied between 0.4 and 6.0 dS m-1. To be of good practical quality as a soilless culture substrate, coir has to be washed during production. The typical pH range for coir is 5.5–6.8; it contains significant amounts of phosphorus (6–60 ppm) and potassium (170–600 ppm) (Robbins and Evans, 2010). A major advantage of coir is its relatively high elasticity and that it can be compressed in so-called coir briquets (Salvador et al., 2005) which facilitate transportation from the country of origin. Since coir contains more lignin and less GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 290 cellulose than peat, it is more resistant to microbial breakdown and may shrink less; it is also easier to re-wet after drying than peat moss (Robbins and Evans, 2010). Bark Bark is a by-product of the wood and paper industry. It is usually stripped from trees, milled and screened into various sizes. As bark can be produced in different particle sizes, it is possible to make different mixes with different physical properties. Furthermore, according to Prasad and Chualáin (2004), the air- and water-holding capacity of bark can be adjusted by varying the percentage of fine material (< 1–2 mm). Bark is described as fresh, aged or composted (Robbins and Evans, 2010). Aged or composted bark is used for plant cultivation (Plate 6). Composting is recommended to eliminate phytotoxins. N may be added during composting to overcome N immobilization (Solbraa, 1979). Bark is a lightweight material with a volume weight of 0.1–0.3 g cm-3 (Raviv et al. 2002). Pine-bark-based substrates provide very good aeration and a moderate amount of available water; however, they have little water-buffering", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

N may be added during composting to overcome N immobilization (Solbraa, 1979). Bark is a lightweight material with a volume weight of 0.1–0.3 g cm-3 (Raviv et al. 2002). Pine-bark-based substrates provide very good aeration and a moderate amount of available water; however, they have little water-buffering capacity and frequent irrigation is required. Owen et al. (2008) suggested, therefore, amending bark substrate with industrial mineral aggregate following studies showing reduced water application needs and increased plant stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation when plants are grown in such substrates compared with in pine bark alone. Some fresh bark types contain toxins, including high levels of monoterpenes and phenols, which may prove harmful to plants. Tree species, age, harvest time, soil type and geographical region are factors affecting phytotoxicity (Raviv et al., 2002). High manganese content, especially at low pH could also be a source of potential phytotoxicity (Maher and Thomson, 1991). As mentioned earlier, composting or ageing are good measures against phytotoxicity. A positive property of bark is its relatively low cost. Shaw et al. (2007) performed a sensitivity analysis using five years of market data on ‘Galia’ muskmelons to show potential losses and profits using bags or pots filled with GRUDA, 2004 Plate 6 Aged pine bark used as a container substrate for bell pepper cultivation 11. Growing media 291 either perlite or pine bark. An economic analysis determined that pine bark was nearly one-eighth the cost of perlite and could be reused for several consecutive crops, resulting in reduced production costs and greater profits. However, bark could become a limited resource due to the changing timber industry and the fact that it is an effective energy source (Owen et al., 2008). Sawdust The volume weight of sawdust is slightly less than sphagnum peat moss; it has similar water retention to pine bark but greater air space after drainage (Bilderback, 1982). As with hardwood bark, plant growth is restricted in uncomposted sawdust. However, the carbon to nitrogen ratio is much higher in sawdust than in bark and N must be added: an estimated 2–3 percent N by weight is required to compost sawdust. On the other hand, hardwood sawdust decays more rapidly than softwood sawdust and requires about 1 percent more N by weight to achieve decomposition (Worrall, 1985). Moreover, old sawdust has a lower N requirement than fresh sawdust. Handreck and Black (2005) reported rapid decomposition of whitewood sawdust in pots, with volume loss of up to 50 percent in one year, causing slumping and sometimes an enormous loss of air porosity. The microbes causing this decomposition have a high soluble nitrogen requirement, necessitating heavy applications of nitrogen fertilizer (Handreck and Black, 2005). Starck et al. (1991) found the lowest content of total and soluble nitrogen in leaves of carnation plants grown in sawdust in comparison to peat or mixtures of peat and sawdust. Higher doses of nitrogen increased the inflorescence diameter of plants grown in sawdust and in a mixture of 25 percent peat and 75 percent sawdust. In addition, using hardwood sawdust as a growing medium, it was found that wood contained phytotoxins negatively affecting plant growth (Maas and Adamson, 1982). Woodchips and wood fibre substrates Woodchips are readily available materials from the wood and paper industry. Pure untreated spruce and pine woodchippings with little bark from the woodworking industry can be shredded under frictional pressure and a wood fibre substrate (WFS) produced. The TPS of wood fibre substrates is similar to that of peat substrates and is over 90 percent, while the volume weight is generally 0.083–1.50, depending on the particle size and substrate compaction. The diminution of particle size leads to an increase in the volume weight (Gruda and Schnitzler, 2004a). Wood fibre substrates are characterized by low water retention with less easily available water and water-buffering capacity compared with peat-based substrates, good air content and high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Gruda and Schnitzler, 2004a; Gruda, 2005). Therefore, frequent irrigation is very important when wood fibres are used as growing media; optimal plant growth requires high moisture levels. Gruda and Schnitzler (2000) recommend irrigation set points at -30 hPa for optimal morphological leaf and root development of tomato transplants in an ebb/flood system;", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Gruda and Schnitzler (2000) recommend irrigation set points at -30 hPa for optimal morphological leaf and root development of tomato transplants in an ebb/flood system; the irrigation frequency must be higher than in a peat-based substrate. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 292 As with sawdust, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of woodchips and wood fibres is extremely high, requiring adequate amounts of nitrogen and composting to avoid negative effects on plant growth. In strongly fibrous and relatively loose wood substrates, micro-organism activity is sturdily promoted. The micro-organisms need mineral nitrogen for the synthesis of their own protein components. The immobilized N is no longer available for plants. N-immobilization in wood substrates can cause substantial nourishment problems for cultivated plants and thus become one of the most important factors leading to possible yield losses (Gruda and Schnitzler, 1997 and 1999b; Gruda et al., 2000). However, nowadays specially produced N-impregnated wood fibres can be used to reduce subsequent N-deficiency during the growing period. Gruda et al. (2000) studied the mechanism of N-immobilization for white peat and for WFSs with and without additional impregnation. Three levels of nitrogen fertilizer were tested. N-immobilization was calculated on the basis of N-balance including N-uptake by plants and residual mineral N in the substrates. Strong net N-immobilization was revealed in non-impregnated wood fibre substrates. In white peat and WFS Toresa spezial, N-immobilization was low with little variation in the values. N-immobilization for pots with and without plants was approximately 100 mg per litre for all three N-levels. The authors, therefore, recommended the use of N-impregnated wood fibre substrates with additional N-fertilization. However, general recommendations about additional fertilizer are difficult, given the strongly varying mineral nutrient content of different substrate loads. Worldwide competition in the wood products industry also influences the prices of wood-based substrate; in recent years, the energy crisis has made the situation even more critical as wood is used as renewable fuel material. While the use of wood as an energy source is not a new phenomenon, the impact of its use as a biomass energy source has increased significantly in recent years. Compost The term compost is used to describe all organic matter that has undergone long, thermophilic, aerobic decomposition. Composts can vary according to the raw material used and the exact nature of the process (Raviv et al., 2002). A wide range of organic waste can be composted for use as growing media: municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, poultry litter, chicken manure and other animal excreta, poppy straw, cotton gin trash, and waste from the food and processing industry. The latter includes apple pomace (Chong, 1992), corn cobs (Kianirad et al., 2009), cotton gin waste (Krewer et al., 2002), grape marc (Reis et al., 2003), grape stalks (Tattini et al., 1992), olive marc (Pages et al., 1985), olive-mill waste (Papafotiou et al., 2004 and 2005), sugarcane fibre or bagasse (Cintra et al., 2004) and vegetable residues (Vallini et al., 1992). 11. Growing media 293 Prasad and Maher (2001) recommend using composted materials such as green waste and biowaste as a component of a growing medium (up to 50 percent) but not on their own. Constraints to the use of composted green waste are: high EC, high concentration of potassium, nitrogen and ammonium, and high shrinkage (Handreck and Black, 2005). Plant pathogens and weed contamination could also be potential problems if the temperatures and time exposure are insufficient and the composting process is not properly conducted (Gruda et al., 2006). However, through a good composting process, compost generally possesses a suppressive effect against pathogens. Using compost provides alternatives in sustainable horticulture. The physical and biochemical properties of compost used as growing media vary greatly, depending on the materials used, the method adopted and the stage of maturity. The most beneficial effect of compost inclusion in a growth medium is its nutritional contribution. Non-mature compost can immobilize a significant amount of N, but once stabilized, compost acts, to a large extent, as a slow-release fertilizer (Raviv et al., 2002).

GROWING MEDIA REUSE In soilless crops, the substrate is not renewed each year, but reused for successive growth cycles. Each time a soilless growing system is replanted, roots are left in the substrate and organic matter may be partially decomposed, increasing water- holding capacity and in some cases CEC. Possible consequences of reuse are: variation in structure and composition, variation in the air-filled porosity and water-holding capacity ratio, and contamination by soil-borne diseases. The international trend for substrate development tends towards the use of natural resources and renewable raw materials. When growing media companies, even peat producers, in the medium and long term actively participate in the search for peat alternatives and invest in new innovative technology, they will be investing in their future (Gruda, 2012a). A high value in the future will be given to substrate development, assurance of quality of the final product, and the suitability for plant cultivation by simultaneously respecting environmental aspects and sustainability (Gruda, 2005).

GAP recommendations • The wide range of substrates available means it is difficult to make a correct choice. For appropriate management of nutrient solution and fertigation, information concerning their chemical and physical characteristics is required; even within the same substrate, significant variations can occur: - Determine the substrate’s physical and chemical characteristics and, if necessary, make adjustments to meet plant requirements. • Shape and volume of the container affect water-holding capacity: - Consider the container when choosing a substrate. • Choice of substrate depends on the grower’s capability to handle growing media with characteristics that can greatly differ from those of agricultural soil: - Acquire the necessary information and know-how. • Adapt the irrigation strategy to the physical properties of the substrate. • The agro-economic suitability of a given substrate is not the sole consideration. The direct (i.e. substrate disposal) and indirect (i.e. leaching requirement) environmental impact must be taken into account in order to improve the efficiency lato sensu of the adopted soilless growing systems. Growing media companies and vegetable producers are no longer evaluated only according to their financial success: - Consider sustainability and environmental protection. - Adopt green technologies. 11.

The fertilizers containing the nutrients to be supplied to the crop are dissolved in the appropriate concentration in the irrigation water and the resultant solution is referred to as “nutrient solution”. In soilless crops, the plant roots may grow either in porous media (substrates), which are frequently irrigated with nutrient solution (see chapter 11), or directly in nutrient solution without any solid phase. In recent decades, supplying nutrient solution to plants to optimize crop nutrition (fertigation or liquid fertilization) has become routine cultural practice, not only in soilless culture but also in soil- grown greenhouse crops. Hence, the drastically restricted volume of the rooting medium and its uniformity are the only characteristics of soilless cultivated crops differentiating them from crops grown in the soil. In recent years, cultivation in inorganic substrates has been characterized by a shift from open- to closed-cycle cultivation systems, involving reuse of drainage solution. The cultivation of greenhouse crops in closed hydroponic systems can substantially reduce the pollution of water resources by nitrates and phosphates stemming from fertigation effluents, and contribute to an appreciable reduction in water and fertilizer consumption (Savvas, 2002). Switching over to closed cultivation systems does not seem to restrict crop yield or product quality. However, a factor limiting the broad expansion of closed-cycle cultivation systems in substrate-grown crops is the accumulation of salt ions in the recycled nutrient solution. This phenomenon originates from the inlet of salt ions and water at higher ratios (concentrations in the irrigation water) than the corresponding ion- GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 304 to-water uptake ratios (Sonneveld, 2002). Furthermore, the reuse of the nutrient solution effluents in closed soilless culture systems is associated with the risk of disease spread via the recycled leachate, which entails the installation of a solution disinfection system (Wohanka, 2002). The rapid expansion worldwide of hydroponic systems in the last three decades may be ascribed to their independence from the soil and its associated problems, i.e. the presence of soil-borne pathogens at the start of the crop and the decline of soil structure and fertility due to continual cultivation with the same or relative crop species. Soilless cultivation appears to be the safest and most effective alternative to soil disinfection by means of methyl bromide. It is therefore becoming increasingly important in protected cultivation – not only in modern, fully equipped glasshouses, but also in simple greenhouse constructions designed to optimize favourable climatic conditions. Hydroponic systems offer numerous advantages: • Absence of soil-borne pathogens. • Safe alternative to soil disinfection. • Possibility to cultivate greenhouse crops and achieve high yields and good quality, even in saline or sodic soils, or in non-arable soils with poor structure (accounting for much of the world’s cultivable land). • Precise control of nutrition, particularly in crops grown on inert substrates or in pure nutrient solution (also in soilless crops grown in chemically active growing media, plant nutrition can be better controlled than in soil-grown crops, due to the limited media volume per plant and the homogeneous media constitution). • Avoidance of soil tillage and preparation, thereby increasing crop length and total yield in greenhouses. • Enhancement of early yield in crops planted during the cold season, because of higher temperatures in the root zone during the day. • Respect for environmental policies (e.g. reduction of fertilizer application and restriction or elimination of nutrient leaching from greenhouses to the environment) – therefore, in many countries, the application of closed hydroponic systems in greenhouses is compulsory by legislation, particularly in environmentally protected areas, or those with limited water resources. Despite the considerable advantages of commercial soilless culture, there are disadvantages limiting its expansion in some cases: • High installation costs. • Technical skills requirements.

Despite the considerable advantages of commercial soilless culture, there are disadvantages limiting its expansion in some cases: • High installation costs. • Technical skills requirements. Root aeration is a key factor for successful soilless cultivation. Understanding the factors influencing air availability in growing media is important for the successful management of substrate-grown crops. Oxygen deficiency may 12. Soilless culture 305 readily occur in media with relatively low air-filled porosity, especially if the plants exhibit high growth rates and concomitantly intensive root respiration. When growing media characterized by low air-filled porosity are used, a good agricultural practice for avoiding aeration problems is to place the substrate in bags, containers or troughs in layers of at least 20 cm. In countries where cultivation in greenhouses has reached industrial dimensions, these disadvantages are of minor importance. The average greenhouse size per enterprise is comparatively large and the investment costs per unit of greenhouse area high in order to maximize yield and optimize product quality by completely controlling all growing conditions. Therefore, the inclusion of equipment for hydroponics – a small aliquot of the total investment – constitutes the necessary supplement to exclude the last imponderable factor that could restrict yield and quality: the soil. Major greenhouse enterprises can afford the costs of specialized personnel or external advisory services and thus, the requirement for sufficient technical skills is not a problem. In contrast, when the greenhouse is a simple construction mainly based on favourable natural conditions (mild winter and increased solar irradiation), even a small increase in the installation and operation costs (as required for the introduction of hydroponics) may not be justifiable. The investment can be acceptable only when problems originating from the soil become critical, water resources are limited, or pollution of the environment by nutrient leaching is serious. The result is that commercial hydroponics is relatively limited in most Mediterranean countries. SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT Intense research and experimental activities in soilless cultivation have led to the development of numerous systems characterized by different water volume, methods of water supply, nutrition management, size and shape of growing modules, and by the presence or absence of a variety of growing media (substrates). Soilless cultures are usually classified according to the type of plant support as substrate culture (artificial, mineral or organic growing media, or a mixture of these) and water culture or hydroponic, where roots are partially or completely dipped in the nutrient solution (Figure 1). For several reasons – differences in nutrient supply throughout the delivery system, varying plant growth and consequent differences in rate of nutrient uptake, and the quality of irrigation water (often scarce) – the supply of nutrients and water solution must exceed the crop’s needs. Excess of nutrients and water assures that all plants are adequately fed, and leaching avoids excessive concentration of salts and non-essential elements (e.g. sodium) at root level. Soilless systems are also categorized in terms of management of the leachate (drained solution) as either open- or closed-loop systems. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 306 Feeding plants in soilless systems In all modern soilless systems, fertilization and irrigation are integrated into one system able to supply fertilizers and water at the same time (fertigation). Once it became evident that all nutrients essential for crops (macro- and micronutrients) could be supplied through hydrosoluble fertilizer salts, systems were developed with fertilizers dissolved at relatively high concentrations in special stock solutions. Stock solutions are injected and diluted in the irrigation water. Generally, two fertilizer tanks containing the stock solutions are used to separate fertilizers that can interact. A possible combination is a tank “A” containing essentially calcium fertilizers and a tank “B” with essentially phosphate and sulphate fertilizers. In this way, Ca is separated from P and SO4-S to avoid precipitation of calcium phosphate or calcium sulphate, which are sparingly soluble. A third tank “C” contains a concentrated solution of an inorganic acid which is used to control the pH of the nutrient solution obtained after the injection of the stock solutions into the irrigation water, and to wash the irrigation system and avoid clogging of the nutrient solution emitters.

Open- and closed-loop soilless systems In open-loop systems the water and nutrients are supplied as for a conventional on-soil crop and the drained nutrient solution is thrown out of the system. The leachate may be collected and reused to fertilize on-soil crops, but in most cases it is lost causing harm to the environment (Figure 2). Open-loop systems determine the nutrient solution to supply in conjunction with leaching, i.e. the volumetric ratio of the leachate to the applied nutrient solution. In closed-loop systems the drained nutrient solution is recovered, replenished and recycled (Figure 3). Compared with the open-loop system, it requires more FIGURE 1 Classification of soilless culture systems Soilless culture Water culture or hydroponic • Deepwater culture • Float hydroponics • Nutrient film technique • Deepflow technique • Aeroponics Substrate culture • Gravel culture • Sand culture • Bag culture • Container culture • Trough culture 12.

The returned nutrient solution has to be treated to restore its original nutrient element composition and to remove any foreign substances. Moreover, spreading of root-borne diseases may occur, thus sterilization of the solution must be provided to kill pathogens. Water culture or hydroponic systems Deep water culture (DWC) DWC, created in 1929 by Professor W.F. Gericke of the University of California, was the first hydroponic method proposed for commercial purposes. It consists of a bucket filled with nutrient solution, covered with a net and a cloth on which a thin layer of sand (1 cm) is placed to support the plants; the roots are suspended in the nutrient solution. Alternatively, the bucket may be covered with a lid and the plants, contained in net pots, suspended from the centre of the cover. The main drawback of the system is the hypoxic conditions occurring at root level, due to the limited air-water exchange area, compared with the volume of the solution, and the low diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the water. This constraint has been overcome by means of air pumps oxygenating the nutrient solution or by applying recirculating deep water culture systems (RDWC) that use a reservoir to provide nutrient solution to multiple buckets. In RDWC, as the water is reintroduced to the reservoir it is broken up and aerated with the use of spray nozzles. Float hydroponics Plants are grown on trays floating in tanks filled with nutrient solution. This method has a long history but its use in greenhouse production spread following the introduction of high density polystyrene or other “ultralight” plastic (e.g. Styrofoam) trays. It was used for the first time by Professor Franco Massantini at the University of Pisa, Italy, in 1976, to grow lettuce, cardoon and strawberry. Nowadays, the technique is principally adopted for the cultivation of fresh-cut leafy vegetables (lettuce, chicory, rocket, lamb’s lettuce etc.) and aromatics (basil, mint, thyme etc.). The system appears to be particularly interesting due to the low set-up and management costs and the little automation required for monitoring and adjusting the nutrient solution.

Classic FH systems are based on tanks 0.20–0.30 m deep, made of low-cost material (concrete, bricks, wooden planks) or directly dug into the greenhouse. Tanks are sealed (e.g. waterproofing with PE film) and filled with nutrient solution (150–250 litres m-2). The large volume of nutrient solution buffers the temperature and reduces the frequency of adjustment and reintegration of the solution. During the growing season, the O2 concentration in the nutrient solution should range between 5 and 6 mg per litre. The easiest way to oxygenate 12. Soilless culture 309 the nutrient solution is by pumps that drive part of the solution into a pipe onto which a Venturi tube is inserted to insufflate air. However, the airflow should never become very strong, to avoid root damage and recirculation of plant exudates. In the greenhouse, a single-tank or multiple-tank system may be used (Plate 1). The former, taking up almost the whole of the span, reduces the incidence of barren areas and allows the automation of certain operations, such as the placement and removal of floating trays; the latter consists of several tanks of ≥ 4 m2 (2 × 2 m), with spacing of 0.5–1.0 m, and it reduces the risk of operational mistakes and diseases. Nutrient film technique (NFT) NFT is a hydroponic technique whereby a very thin layer (film) of nutrient solution flows through watertight channels (also known as gullies, troughs or gutters), wherein the bare roots of plants lie (Plate 2). Channels are on a slope of 1.2–3.0 percent and nutrient solution is applied at the elevated end so that the solution flows down through the channels keeping the roots completely wet. The slope may be provided by the floor itself, or benches or racks may hold the channels and provide the required elevation. The thin water stream (1–2 mm deep) ensures sufficient oxygenation of the roots, as the thick root mat which develops on the bottom of the channel has its upper surface continuously exposed to the air. At the lower end of the channels, the solution is drained to a large catchment pipe, which conducts the solution back to the cistern to be recirculated. Depressions in the channel floors must be avoided because ponds of immobile solution will lead to oxygen depletion and growth retardation.

SAVVAS GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 310 Channels generally consist of various types of plastic material, such as polyethylene liner, polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polypropylene, with a rectangle- or triangle-shaped section. The base of the channel must be flat and not curved so as to maintain a shallow stream of liquid. Depending on the crop and the size of the channels, inlet flow rates vary between 1 and 3 litres per minute (2–9 litres m-2 h-1). Lower waterflow rates are recommended for crops such as lettuce, higher rates for fruiting vegetables. A distinction may also be made between the inflow rates needed for a young crop (e.g. 2–4 litres m-2 h-1) and a mature crop (e.g. 5–9 litres m-2 h-1). Flow rates beyond this range are often associated either with oxygenation or nutritional problems: too rapid and the water becomes too deep and oxygenation of the roots inadequate; too slow and the result is lack of nutrients, especially for plants with roots downstream in the channel and exposed to water from which many other plants have already extracted nutrients, especially nitrogen and potassium. The rate of nutrient depletion along the channel also depends on length. As a rule, length should not exceed 12–16 m. In order to overcome these problems, a modified system called super nutrient film technique (SNFT) has been developed: nutrient solution is distributed by nozzles arranged along the channel, ensuring adequate availability of both nutrients and oxygen near the roots.

In order to overcome these problems, a modified system called super nutrient film technique (SNFT) has been developed: nutrient solution is distributed by nozzles arranged along the channel, ensuring adequate availability of both nutrients and oxygen near the roots. The delivery of nutrient solution may be continuous in a 24-hour cycle, or intermittent (alternating watering and dry periods to improve oxygenation of the root system). Another possibility – a compromise between these two approaches – is the continuous recirculation of the nutrient solution during daylight hours (dawn to dusk) and the automated switching off at night. Nevertheless, if recirculation of nutrient solution is intermittent, the volume capacity of the catchment tank has to be large enough to admit all the nutrient solution included in the system when recirculation is switched off. Before transplanting, the channels are usually covered with a black-on-white polyethylene film (0.15–0.25 mm thick), placing the film with the white side facing outwards (to reflect light and avoid excessive heating of the root and nutrient solution) and the black side inwards (to avoid light transmission and consequent development of algae). Plants destined for use in NFT systems are raised in small pots or plugs or in rockwool cubes and are placed in the channels when a substantial root system has formed. The main advantages of NFT over other systems are the absence of substrate and the reduced volume of nutrient solution required, resulting in significant savings in water and fertilizers and reduced environmental impact and costs related to the disposal of the substrate. On the other hand, owing to the low water volume, the nutrient solution is subjected to major temperature changes along the channel and during growing seasons. Moreover, NFT has very little buffering against interruptions in water and nutrient supplies, and there is a considerable risk of the spread of root-borne diseases. Technically most crops could be grown 12. Soilless culture 311 in a NFT system, but it works best for short-term crops (30–50 days), such as lettuce, because plants are ready to harvest before their root mass fills the channel. Deep flow technique (DFT) DFT is another method where roots are continuously exposed to moving water and nutrients. While with NFT, the water stream is as thin as possible, in DFT the continuously flowing nutrient solution has a depth of 50–150 mm. The large water volume simplifies the control of the nutrient solution and buffers the temperature, making the system suitable for regions where temperature fluctuation in the nutrient solution can be a problem. The width of the channels in a DFT system are usually about 1 m. Plants are grown on polystyrene trays which float on the water or rest on the channel sidewalls. Aeroponics Aeroponics is the growing of plants with the root system suspended in a fine mist of nutrient solution applied continuously or intermittently. Plants are secured in holes on polystyrene panels using polyurethane foam: panels are placed horizontally or on a slope, and fixed over a metal frame, arranging closed containers with a square or triangular section (Plate 3). Water and nutrients are supplied by spraying the plant’s dangling roots with an atomized nutrient solution by means of sprayers, misters or foggers inserted in PE or PVC pipes placed in the unit. The flow rate of the sprayers may range from 35 to 70 litres h-1, whereas the spacing depends on the design and size of the cropping modules. As a general indication, they should be placed about 0.50 m apart to assure homogeneous nebulization all along the aeroponic unit. Spraying usually lasts 30–60 seconds, and their frequency varies according to species, plant growth stage, growing season and time of day (e.g. in summer, during rapid vegetative growth, a crop grown in northeast Italy may require up to 80 sprayings per day). At each nebulization, the drainage is collected at the bottom of the modules and recirculated. Aeroponics permits a major reduction in water and fertilizer consumption and ensures adequate oxygenation of the roots. However, aeroponically grown plants may experience severe thermal stresses, especially in summer. Another disadvantage is the inability to buffer interruptions in the flow of nutrient solution (e.g. power outages).

Substrates retain nutrient solution reserves, thereby buffering interruptions in water and nutrient supply, and protect roots from temperature fluctuations. Cultivation on substrates is currently the primary soilless system used for the production of greenhouse peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes. Several substrates may be adopted as a growing medium in soilless cultivation and the choice is mainly based on water retention and water dynamics. Growing media for soilless systems are basically available as plastic encased slabs (e.g. rockwool, coir), prepacked substrate in plastic bags (e.g. perlite, peat, coir) or loose substrate granules placed directly in troughs, buckets or other containers made of strong and long-lasting plastic material. Gravel culture Gravel culture provides growing beds on a slope of 0.2–0.3 percent built either by digging the soil or as above-ground troughs. The beds are lined with thick plastic film (e.g. 0.5 mm black PE film) with a length of up to 30–40 m. In most gravel culture systems, subirrigation is applied. Alternatively, as in NFT systems, nutrient solution is applied at the high end, it flows down the trough and is drained at the lower end to be recovered and recirculated; this modified gravel culture system is known as the gravel film technique (GFT) (Plate 4). The best choice of gravel for both subirrigation and GFT systems is particles of porphyry or granite of irregular shape and 3–20 mm diameter (> 50 percent of particles 10–15 mm diameter). The particles should not be of calcareous material in order to avoid pH alterations. If drip irrigation is used rather than subirrigation, smaller aggregates must be used (3–10 mm diameter; > 50 percent about 5 mm). Sand culture Plastic-lined beds are used (as for gravel culture) or sand is spread over the entire greenhouse floor. A drip irrigation system is used to feed each plant individually; waste nutrient solution is usually not recycled (open-loop system). A particular type of sand culture is enarenado (Plate 5): still widely used for greenhouse production in Almería, it was created to overcome the extremely poor indigenous soils in the region. Enarenado is prepared by levelling the soil and lining it with a layer of Plate 4 Gravel Film Technique (GFT) – porphyry beds G. GIANQUINTO 12. Soilless culture 313 compacted clay (about 20 cm), followed by a layer of 2–3 cm of fermented manure or organic material (composted crop residues). A layer of 10 cm of washed beach sand or coarse grit finally sits on the bed. The clay layer has a double function: preventing water leaking into the ground; stopping capillary rise from the saline watertable. Bag culture Bag culture is the cultivation of plants on plastic bags filled with either porous slabs or loose granules (Plate 6). The substrate-filled bags may be manufactured and purchased as ready-to-use bags or filled by the grower. Slab-type growing media are either rockwool or coir; rockwool slabs are usually about 90 cm long, 8–10 cm high and 15–20 cm wide. The 15-cm-wide slabs are best suited for growing plants like pepper and tomato. The wider slabs are for crops such as cucumbers that require a strong and stable base and a large root capacity. Coir slabs expand their size after rehydration, reaching 90–110 cm in length, 15–20 cm in width and 6–12 cm in height.

GIANQUINTO AND VENETO AGRICOLTURA GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 314 The granulated materials most widely used in Mediterranean countries as substrates in bag culture are perlite, peat, coir, pumice or a mixture. Bags are placed in channels or panels to collect the drainage solution. Planting holes are cut in the top (Plate 7); the number of planting holes varies depending on the crop, but as a guide, 3–5 tomatoes can be planted into a slab or bag 90–100 cm long and 15–20 cm wide. As soon as planting holes are ready, one dripper per hole is put in position, and the substrate is saturated with nutrient solution. Saturation is maintained for 24–48 hours to allow the substrate to absorb the solution. Small holes or cuts are made along the base of the plastic envelope to allow excess nutrient solution to drain (Plate 8). Saturation serves to extract the air and provide homogeneous wetting of the growing medium, providing adequate water and nutrient reserves and optimal EC and pH conditions in the plant root zone, and diluting accumulated salts (in the case of substrate reuse). Transplants rooted in rockwool cubes or similar media are planted when the roots are about to emerge from the base of the cube (Plate 9).

SAVVAS 12. Soilless culture 315 is delivered via a drip irrigation system (1 or 2 drippers per plant, dripper capacity of 2–4 litres h-1). The nutrient solution may be recycled or not, but in open-loop systems an environmentally acceptable means of disposal of the effluent from the substrate is required. Slabs and bags can be reused several times and then they must be discarded. Container culture Different containers – PE, PVC or polystyrene buckets or pots (Plate 10) – are used. The volume of the containers varies from 12 to 18 litres and 1–2 plants per container are usually planted. The container depth is important for adequate root development and plant growth, and the deeper the container the higher the ratio of air to water in the substrate. The container depth depends on crop, length of growing season and type of substrate. In general, a depth of > 20 cm is required. A drip irrigation system is used to feed each plant individually and drainage is usually ensured by an overflow opening in the base of the container. The growing media most commonly used in container culture are peat and coir (plain or mixed with perlite, pumice, lapilli or zeolite) and perlite. The same general operating procedures are used as with bag culture. Trough culture Plants grow on plastic or plastic-lined troughs built above ground (Plates 11 and 12). Trough depth varies from 10 to 35 cm depending on the substrate and particle size (0.3–0.5 mm particles require a depth of at least 35 cm). Troughs should have a uniform slope of 0.5 percent.

The growing media used in trough culture and the general operating procedures are the same as those applied in container culture. Greenhouse layout and equipment As a rule, in soilless culture the soil is covered with black-on-white polyethylene film (0.20–0.25 mm thick). The film is placed with the white side facing up to maximize reflection, improve brightness at plant level and minimize the trapping of excess heat inside the greenhouse. The black side faces downwards to control weeds. Mulching reduces the relative humidity of the air, eliminating evaporation from the soil and preventing contact between plants and soil, thus reducing the risk of disease. Soilless culture (except DWC and FH) requires fertigation systems: to mix appropriately water and fertilizers dissolved in concentrated stock solutions; and to uniformly supply feed solution to every plant. Fertigation equipment typically comprises the following: • Pressure regulators to reduce incoming water pressure to a set pressure suitable for the delivery system. • Filters (typically 80 micron or 200 mesh) to protect from blockages caused by water impurity or precipitated salts. • Tanks for stock and for acid solution, made of inert materials resistant to acids and salts (usually polypropylene or PVC) and typically ≥ 1 000-litre volume for chemical storage between injection times. Trough culture Advantages: • Easily adapted to small scale farmers’ conditions since similar to soil • Any problems in the individual drippers could be tolerated • Suitable for crops with high plant density (e.g. lettuce) Disadvantages: • Needs labour to fill and change substrate • Substrate volume per plant is generally higher G. GIANQUINTO Plate 12 Tomatoes grown in plastic-lined troughs built above-ground and filled with coir, Morocco 12. Soilless culture 317 • Fertilizer injection devices to take a small amount of stock solution and introduce it into the waterline for delivery to plants. • pH and EC measuring tools – the pH (acidity or alkalinity) and electrical conductivity (EC) of water and nutrient solution are measured using pH meters and EC meters, respectively. • Water/solution delivering system – the equipment used to supply nutrient solution in liquid hydroponic systems is illustrated above; in substrate- grown soilless crops, nutrient solution is delivered via a drip irrigation system with microtubes (commonly known as spaghetti tubes) as emitters. The injection of stock solution in the irrigation pipe (Figure 4, left) is inappropriate with high bicarbonate concentration in the water; the pressure caused by the formation of CO2 owing to the acid-bicarbonate reaction does not allow completion of the reaction itself. Thus as the water pressure inside the line decreases (e.g. at emitter level), the acid-bicarbonate reaction stops and the solution pH increases. Injection of stock solutions into a mixing tank (Figure 4, right) ensures that all water enters into an open tank where stock and acid solutions are injected on the basis of continuously monitored EC and pH values; the feed solution is then injected into the main pipe. This system has advantages: • The EC and pH values of the solution are fairly constant. • The solution remains in the mixing tank for a sufficiently long time to allow for a complete reaction between acid and bicarbonate. • An open tank allows the removal of CO2 from the solution, thus speeding up the acid-bicarbonate reaction.

Savvas GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 318 CROP NUTRITION IN SOILLESS CULTURE Principles In soilless culture, all essential plant nutrients should be supplied via the nutrient solution, with the exception of carbon, taken up from the air as CO2. To prepare nutrient solutions containing all essential nutrients, inorganic fertilizers are used as nutrient sources, except for iron, which is added in chelated form to improve its availability for the plants. Most fertilizers used to prepare nutrient solutions in soilless culture are highly soluble inorganic salts but some inorganic acids are also used. A brief description of the water soluble fertilizers commonly used in soilless culture is given in Table 1. Note that fertilizer injection devices can be classified into volumetric (or quantitative) and proportional injectors: Volumetric injectors are relatively easy-to-use and their cost is low but they are affected by water pressure changes and cannot adjust fertilizer concentration to EC or pH fluctuations occurring in the water. The simplest volumetric injector is based on Venturi devices that reduce pressure (vacuum), sucking the fertilizer solution into the line. With other devices (e.g. Dosatron), the amount of stock solution is directly proportional to the volume of water entering the injector, irrespective of variations in waterflow or pressure which may occur in the main waterline. Volumetric dosage can also be performed by electric pumps, but in this case the cost increases. Proportional injectors include electric pumps (diaphragm or piston) able to dispense stock solutions either into the waterline or into a mixing tank, depending on the EC or pH value detected downstream. The main advantages of these devices are: accuracy in obtaining a solution with fixed pH and EC – so they are suitable for water characterized by variations in chemical composition and for closed- loop soilless systems; and automation easy to apply. Their main drawback is the high cost and maintenance requirement.

Soilless culture 319 In commercial soilless culture, the fertilizers needed to prepare a nutrient solution are mixed with water to form concentrated stock solutions, which are then automatically mixed with irrigation water to form nutrient solution. Composition of nutrient solution To formulate the composition of a nutrient solution for a certain crop, experimental results concerning the nutritional requirements of the particular plant species should be available. Such data are also essential to check and adjust the nutritional status in the root zone during the cropping period. The composition of nutrient solutions and the optimization of nutrition in commercial hydroponics have been primary objectives of research related to soilless culture in recent decades. The pioneer work on the composition of nutrient solutions was carried out by American scientists before the Second World War and resulted in the formula of Hoagland and Arnon (1950), widely used for research purposes even today.

With the support of new developments in analytical techniques and equipment, specific nutrient solutions were formulated for each greenhouse crop species. Such formulae have been published by Sonneveld and Straver (1994), Resh (1997), De Kreij et al. (1999), Papadopoulos (1991 and 1994), Adams (2002) etc. Two examples of formulae suggested by Sonneveld and Straver (1994) for cucumber and tomato are given in Table 2. In commercial practice, it is not easy to implement nutrient solution formulae like those given in Table 2. The first difficulty arises from the mineral composition of the irrigation water. In most cases, irrigation water contains macronutrients (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-), micronutrients (Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, B and Cl-) and other non-nutrient ions (HCO3-, Na+) at appreciably high concentrations. When the concentration of a nutrient element in the irrigation water represents a non- negligible fraction of the target concentration in the nutrient solution, the grower has to deduct the amount that is already available in the irrigation water from the total required amount in the nutrient solution. The concentration of bicarbonates (HCO3-) in the irrigation water is also very important since it determines the amount of acid required for pH adjustment. Furthermore, the concentration of Na+ has to be taken into consideration, since it determines the ultimate EC of the nutrient solution supplied to the crop. However, since the concentrations of all these nutrient and non-nutrient ions are different in the irrigation water used by each individual grower, the amount of fertilizer required to prepare a nutrient solution with a standard composition differs from grower to grower. Thus, the calculations have to be performed individually for each grower. A further difficulty is the inability to supply a certain amount of a macronutrient independently of the supply of the other macronutrients, due to the lack of single- nutrient fertilizers (with the exception of N). For example, soluble potassium (K+) can be added either as KOH or as a salt (KCl, KNO3, KH2PO4, K2SO4 etc.) to an TABLE 2 Composition of standard nutrient solutions Macronutrient H&A S&S (cucumber) S&S (tomato) Micronutrient H&A S&S (cucumber) S&S (tomato) mmol per litre μmol per litre NO3- 14.0 16.00 17.00 Fe 25.00 15.00 10.00 H2PO4- 1.0 1.25 1.50 Mn 9.10 10.00 10.00 SO42- 2.0 1.375 2.50 Zn 0.75 5.00 4.00 K+ 6.0 8.00 8.00 Cu 0.30 0.75 0.75 NH4+ 1.0 1.25 1.00 B 46.30 25.00 20.00 Ca2+ 4.0 4.00 5.25 Mo 0.10 0.50 0.50 Mg2+ 2.0 1.375 2.00 H&A: As proposed by Hoagland and Arnon (1950) for universal use.

Similarly, the supply of potassium salts results in the concomitant supply of another element in the form of an anion at a fixed molar ratio depending on the valence of this anion (normally either 1:1 or 2:1). To overcome these complications and avoid laborious repetition, special computer programs have been developed for the calculation of the amounts of individual fertilizers required to prepare a nutrient solution with a given composition using irrigation water. Savvas and Adamidis (1999) have proposed a simple program that can be easily applied to calculate the amount of fertilizer needed to prepare commercial nutrient solutions when a target composition is available and the mineral composition of the irrigation water is known. This program, which operates via a Microsoft EXCEL® platform, is freely accessed via the Internet at: www.ekk.aua.gr/excel/index_en.htm. To calculate the amount of fertilizer needed to prepare a nutrient solution using a computer program, it is necessary to introduce input data describing its composition. When using a program based on the algorithm proposed by Savvas and Adamidis (1999), the composition of the nutrient solution has to be defined by selecting target values for the following solution characteristics: • Electrical conductivity (EC) in dS m-1 – a measure of the total salt concentration in the nutrient solution • pH • Levels of K, Ca and Mg, which can be alternatively introduced either as mutual ratios (K:Ca:Mg on a molar basis, denoted by X:Y:Z) or as fixed concentrations (mmol litre-1) • Level of N, which can be defined by specifying one of the following: - a total nitrogen to potassium ratio (total-N/K denoted by R) in combination with an ammonium to total nitrogen ratio (NH4-N/total-N denoted by Nr), both on a molar basis - a total nitrogen to potassium ratio (total-N/K on a molar basis, denoted by R) in combination with a fixed NH4-N concentration (mmol litre-1) - a fixed NO3-N concentration (mmol litre-1) in combination with an ammonium to total nitrogen ratio (NH4-N/total-N on a molar basis, denoted by Nr); or - a fixed NO3-N concentration (mmol litre-1) in combination with a fixed NH4-N concentration (mmol litre-1) • Concentration of H2PO4- (mmol litre-1) • Concentrations of micronutrients (μmol litre-1), specifically Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B and Mo GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 322 If the desired composition of a nutrient solution is given in terms of fixed target concentrations, the EC of this solution is also fixed and can be calculated using the following relationship established by Savvas and Adamidis (1999): Eq. 1 where: E depicts the EC (dS m-1 ) C depicts the sum of the cation concentrations (meq litre-1) in the nutrient solution, including also non-nutrient macrocations, particularly the Na+ concentration Consequently, when only macronutrient concentrations but no macronutrient ratios are given to define the desired nutrient solution composition, it is meaningless to select a target EC, since only one fixed EC, specifically that calculated by Equation 1, is feasible. In contrast, if the desired composition of the nutrient solution is defined by selecting target macronutrient ratios, it is possible to select any desired EC. To calculate the amount of fertilizer needed to prepare a nutrient solution, it is important to introduce also the following information to the computer program, in addition to the data describing the desired composition: • EC, pH and concentrations of nutrients (K, Ca, Mg, NO3-N, SO4-S, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Cl) and non-nutrient ions (Na+ and HCO3-) in the irrigation water used to prepare the nutrient solution • Percentage of Fe in the Fe-chelate used as iron source • Available source of soluble P (KH2PO4 or H3PO4) and percentage of pure H3PO4 in the commercial-grade H3PO4, if the latter is used as P fertilizer (commonly 85%) • Percentage of pure HNO3 in the commercial-grade HNO3, if the latter is used for pH adjustment when preparing the nutrient solution • Available source of B (see Table 1) • Available source of Mo (see Table 1) • Volume of stock solutions (m3) • Desired concentration factor, defined for a particular fertilizer as the ratio of its concentrations in the stock solution and the solution supplied to the crop (commonly 100, dictated by the least solubility of the fertilizers used) The output obtained by implementing a computer program to calculate a nutrient solution comprises the weight of", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

If the target nutrient solution composition introduced as input data includes macronutrient concentrations and not ratios, the computer program 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶= 9.819𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸−1.462 12. Soilless culture 323 also calculates the target EC. The target values of EC and pH are subsequently introduced to the controlling system of the fertigation head used to automatically prepare fresh nutrient solution by diluting the stock solutions. As a rule, the fertilizer used as a source of calcium is calcium nitrate, because calcium phosphates and sulphates are sparingly soluble fertilizers, and calcium chloride would result in the addition of chlorides at undesirable concentrations. Magnesium and sulphates are added in the form of magnesium sulphate. If the target concentration of magnesium is higher than that of sulphate, the extra Mg is added in the form of magnesium nitrate. However, if the target concentration of sulphate is higher than that of magnesium, extra SO42- is needed, added in the form of potassium sulphate. Phosphorus is added as monopotassium phosphate but can alternatively be added as phosphoric acid, depending on the concentration of bicarbonates in the irrigation water. Ammonium is commonly added as ammonium nitrate. Potassium is primarily added as potassium nitrate but, to compute the amount to be added, the concentration of K originating from the addition of potassium sulphate and monopotassium phosphate is deducted from the target K concentration. Nitrate-N is added in the form of calcium nitrate, magnesium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate and nitric acid. The allocation of the required NO3-N to the above referenced NO3-N fertilizers depends on the target concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, SO42-, H2PO4- in the nutrient solution and the concentration of bicarbonates in the irrigation water. The concentration of HCO3- in the irrigation water dictates the amount of HNO3 to be added to control pH but has an impact also on the addition of H3PO4. When preparing fresh nutrient solution by diluting stock solutions with irrigation water, the adjustment of the target pH entails the conversion of the bicarbonates contained in the irrigation water to CO2 (Savvas and Adamidis, 1999). This reaction requires the addition of acid at an H+ : HCO3- molar ratio of 1 : 1. The target P concentration in nutrient solutions rarely exceeds 1.5 mmol per litre. Hence, it is not possible to add more phosphoric acid than that resulting in a P concentration of 1.5 mmol per litre in the nutrient solution. However, the bicarbonate concentrations in most sources of irrigation water in Mediterranean countries are much higher than 1.5 mmol per litre. If the concentration of bicarbonates in the irrigation water is about 0.5–1.0 mM higher than the target P concentration in the nutrient solution, nitric acid has to be used to adjust the target pH, either in addition to phosphoric acid, or as a sole source of H+. High HCO3- concentrations in the irrigation water are essentially accompanied by equally high concentrations of cations, particularly Ca2+ and Mg2+. Thus, when preparing a nutrient solution using tap water with a high HCO3- concentration, an increased addition of NO3- in the form of HNO3 in order to control pH is compensated for by a decreased supply of NO3- in the form of Ca(NO3)2. If a high HCO3- concentration in the tap water is accompanied also by a high Mg2+ concentration, less Mg2+ is added in the form of MgSO4. Then, the necessary SO42- is added in the form of K2SO4, resulting in reduced addition GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 324 of NO3- in the form of KNO3.

The commonly used B fertilizers in soilless culture are sodium tetraborate, sodium octaborate and borax, while the commonly used Mo fertilizers are sodium molybdate and ammonium hepta-molybdate. The selection of the B or Mo fertilizer depends on current availability or market prices and not on the addition of other nutrients or the composition of the irrigation water. An interesting aspect related to the nutrition of soilless-grown plants in greenhouses, which has received attention during the last two decades, is the inclusion of silicon in the nutrient solution. Silicon improves the growth of plants subjected to both abiotic and biotic stress conditions when supplied via the nutrient solution in hydroponics, although it seems to have no effect under non- stress conditions. Silicon is added to the nutrient solution in the form of liquid potassium silicate (SiO2.2KOH), which has a strong alkaline reaction and should, therefore, be supplied to the plants from a separate stock solution tank. The high alkalinity of potassium silicate is controlled by enhancing the HNO3 injection dosage during the process of nutrient solution preparation. The extra supply of nitrogen in the form of HNO3 and K in the form of SiO2.2KOH to the nutrient solution is compensated for by a corresponding reduction in KNO3 injection. Impact of nutrition on yield The EC is considered to be one of the most important properties of the nutrient solutions used in soilless culture. If the EC of a nutrient solution is too low, the supply of some nutrients to the crop may be inadequate. Similarly, when the EC is too high, the plants are exposed to salinity. However, the yield response of the plants to the EC of the nutrient solution may vary widely among different species. Therefore, for each cultivated plant species, the terms “too low” and “too high” need to be quantitatively defined based on experimental results. In semi-arid regions such as those in the Mediterranean Basin, the presence of NaCl at relatively high concentrations in the available irrigation water is a common condition. When such irrigation water is used to prepare nutrient solutions, the concentration of NaCl is added to that of nutrients and thus the EC in the resultant nutrient solution is correspondingly increased. Furthermore, in the Mediterranean region, Ca and Mg may also occur at higher concentrations in the irrigation water than the target concentrations in the nutrient solutions. In such cases, the target Ca and Mg concentrations in the nutrient solution are essentially as high as in the irrigation water and thus higher than the desired level, thereby resulting in a correspondingly higher EC than the target EC level. 12. Soilless culture 325 Some growers in the Netherlands and other parts of the world apply desalination by means of reverse osmosis in order to deal with the problem of high salt concentrations in the irrigation water. However, desalination technologies incur high production costs for growers and are affordable only in high-technology greenhouses used for high-value crops. The growth and yield responses of hydroponically grown plants to the total salt concentration in the nutrient solution may be described by the generalized model presented in Figure 5. According to this model, if the EC is lower than a particular value (a), an increase in the EC to values not exceeding (a) enhances the yield of the crop. If the EC ranges between (a) and (t), where (t) is the upper critical EC level, known as salinity threshold value (STV), the yield of the crop remains constant. However, any further increase in the EC above (t) results in yield decrease. If all nutrients are included at sufficient levels in the nutrient solution, the decreases in growth and yield follow a linear pattern as the EC increases to higher levels than (t). The rate of yield decrease per unit increase of EC is termed salinity", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

If all nutrients are included at sufficient levels in the nutrient solution, the decreases in growth and yield follow a linear pattern as the EC increases to higher levels than (t). The rate of yield decrease per unit increase of EC is termed salinity yield decrease (SYD). The impact of the increased EC on plant growth in hydroponics depends also on the prevailing climatic conditions. As a rule, the detrimental salinity effects are more pronounced under high light intensity and low air humidity. The optimal pH in the root zone of most crop species grown hydroponically ranges from 5.5 to 6.5, although values between 5.0–5.5 and 6.5–7.0 may not cause problems in most crops (Adams, 2002). However, in soilless culture, when maintaining marginal values of the optimum pH range, the risk of exceeding or dropping below them for some time increases due to the limited volume of nutrient solution per plant that is available in the root zone. Most plants, when exposed to external pH levels > 7 or < 5, show growth restrictions (Sonneveld, 2002). Nevertheless, there are also plant species, such as gerbera and cut chrysanthemums, which perform better at low pH due to the higher susceptibility of these species to chlorosis induced by Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu deficiencies. Overall, values of pH above 7.0 in the root zone of soilless cultivated plants can quickly result in the appearance of P-, Fe- and Mn-, but sometimes also in Cu- and Zn-deficiency symptoms. The appearance of P-deficiency at pH values FIGURE 5 Relationship between the relative yield (% of the maximum yield) in soilless-grown tomato crops and the electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution in the root zone Maximum yield is that obtained when a ≤ EC ≤ t, where t is the maximum EC level that does not restrict yield due to salinity, and the percentage of yield reduction at higher EC levels than t is equal to s per unit increase of the EC above t.

Furthermore, the precipitation of calcium phosphate at pH values > 6.2 is an additional reason to maintain the pH below this level in the root zone of soilless-grown plants. The occurrence of Fe-, Mn-, Zn- and Cu-deficiencies at pH values > 6.5–7.0 is associated with increased conversion of these nutrients into insoluble forms which precipitate. In the case of manganese, the precipitation of water-insoluble Mn forms at relatively high pH is further accelerated by an increased activity of Mn-oxidizing bacteria. Iron is the micronutrient with the lowest solubility at high pH. In solution cultures, the free iron ions precipitate even at pH values below 6.5, mainly as iron phosphate. Therefore, Fe should always be added in the form of Fe-chelates in hydroponics, preferably as Fe-DTPA or Fe-EDDHA. When the pH of the nutrient solution in the root zone drops to levels below 4.5–5.0, both plant growth and yield may be impaired. The detrimental effects of low pH levels on growth and yield are mainly attributed to Mn and Al toxicities due to solubilization of various oxides and hydroxides of Mn and Al, which are constituents of the substrate and remain insoluble at pH levels over 5. In addition, the uptake of Ca, Mg and K by the plants may also be restricted at pH ≤ 4 in the root zone, especially if the low pH was imposed by a relatively high NH4-N concentration in the nutrient solution. At pH levels below 4 in the root zone, direct H+ injury to the roots may be observed.

Under such conditions, plants do not have to consume energy to take up or to actively exclude any nutrient ions, whose concentrations are lower or higher than their nutrient-to-water uptake ratios, respectively. However, the nutrient-to-water uptake ratios fluctuate widely in response to different climatic conditions, even within the same day. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a nutrient solution with nutrient concentrations which would be continuously in accordance with the corresponding nutrient-to-water uptake ratios. On the other hand, due to the very low volume of nutrient solution per plant, changes in the nutrient-to-water uptake ratio might quickly result in large alterations of the ionic concentrations in the solution. Indeed, due to a more intensive plant uptake during particular time intervals, some nutrients may become depleted while others may accumulate. Therefore, most investigators suggest higher nutrient concentrations than the expected mean nutrient-to-water uptake ratios, in order to ensure adequate supply of all nutrients. Recommended nutrient concentrations for nutrient solutions prescribed to specific plant species grown in greenhouses are given in Table 2. Different plant species have different preferences with regard to nutrient ratios in the nutrient solution. Thus, the determination of the most favourable nutrient ratio for each species is of major importance. Most experiments concerned with 12. Soilless culture 327 effects of nutrient ratios in nutrient solutions focused on the ratio between the metallic macronutrients (K:Ca:Mg or K:Ca), nutrient anion ratios, the N:K (or K:N) ratio and the ratio of NH4+ to total nitrogen. The ratio between the metallic macronutrients is important for the maintenance of the EC in the root zone, since excessively high Ca:K or Mg:K may result in accumulation of these ions. Furthermore, the K:Ca:Mg ratio has a strong impact on the occurrence of physiological disorders, especially in fruit vegetables (Savvas et al., 2008). The N:K and N:S proportions in the nutrient solution are important for the maintenance of a balance between vegetative and reproductive growth and fruit quality (Savvas, 2001). The proportion of NH4+-N to total nitrogen has no impact on the total supply of N to the crop via the nutrient solution, since both NH4+ and NO3- are N sources. However, ammonium to total nitrogen ratio is very important for the regulation of pH in the root environment. Impact of nutrition on produce quality Some consumers are rather mistrustful with regard to vegetables produced in soilless cultivations. This attitude is mainly based on the assumption that the soilless cultivation of plants is based on the extensive use “chemicals”, unlike plants grown in soil which acquire “natural substances” for their nutrition. However, this belief is not based on scientific knowledge. It is well known that higher plants need only inorganic substances, mainly in ionic form, to satisfy their nutritional requirements. Plants take up N as NO3- and NH4+ but not in the form of organic N substances, regardless of the content of organic matter in the soil. Actually, the organic N compounds have to be converted into inorganic N forms before they can be taken up by plants. Consequently, with respect to the quality of the edible vegetable products, it is completely irrelevant whether the nitrogen contained in the plant tissues stems from the organic substances of the soil or from inorganic fertilizers. The only factor influencing the vegetable quality is the quantity of absorbed nitrogen and the way in which it is utilized in the plant metabolism, which has an impact on the NO3-N concentration in the edible plant tissues. However, both these factors are better managed in soilless culture, since the small volumes of rooting medium applied in soilless culture enable a more efficient control of the nutrient supply through the composition of the nutrient solution. Thus, reducing the nitrate nitrogen concentration in the nutrient solution supplied to lettuce or other leafy vegetables for some days prior to harvesting may considerably lower the NO3- content in the leaves of the plants, without significant yield losses.

Moreover, since in hydroponics the plants are grown in substrates, which are free from pathogens when they are initially supplied to the grower, the pressure from soil-borne diseases is much weaker than in soil-grown crops. As a result, the demand for use of soil-disinfecting chemicals is considerably reduced in soilless culture, with obvious advantages for the quality of the vegetables produced. Finally, the taste of some fruit vegetables, such as tomato and melon, may be GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 328 substantially improved in hydroponics by manipulating the total salt and nutrient concentration in the supplied nutrient solution. Nevertheless, many other factors influencing plant growth are different in soilless cultivated crops than in soil- grown crops. Most of these factors also affect the quality of harvested vegetables. Monitoring and adjusting the nutrient supply As a rule, the target nutrient concentrations in the nutrient solution supplied to soilless cultivated crops are different from the optimal concentrations in the root environment. This is the result of dissimilarities in the efficiency of plants to take up different ions owing to the involvement of different absorption mechanisms in each case. Therefore, when instructions regarding the nutrition of a particular plant species in soilless culture are given, it is essential to recommend at least two target nutrient solution compositions, particularly one for the solution supplied to the crop and another one for the solution in the root environment. The nutrient concentrations in the root environment are of paramount importance, since the plant senses and responds to the nutrient status prevailing around its roots. The composition of the nutrient solution supplied to the crop is also very important, although it has only an indirect impact on crop performance, since it is the main tool to achieve and maintain the nutrient concentrations close to the target levels in the root zone. The plant requirements for any particular nutrient may change, independently of those for other nutrients, in the different plant developmental stages. Hence, for plants with a long harvesting period (e.g. tomato) it is better to suggest different target nutrient solution compositions for different plant developmental stages. If the nutrient concentrations in the supplied solution are balanced, monitoring the solution’s EC in the root environment is a good tool to check plant nutrient status. Nevertheless, a chemical analysis in a representative sample of substrate or nutrient solution taken from the root environment at regular intervals (e.g. every month), especially in closed hydroponic systems, could contribute to better and safer nutritional management of the crop. However, the control of the EC in the root environment provides no information on the micronutrient concentrations. Therefore, care should be taken to apply proper target micronutrient concentrations in the supplied nutrient solution. As a rule, the pH maintained in the root zone is more important for micronutrient availability than the macronutrient concentrations per se in the supplied solution. Hence, monitoring the nutrient solution pH in the root zone provides an indirect index regarding the availability of micronutrients for the crop. However, especially for some microelements, the concentration in the supplied nutrient solution is crucial. This is the case with boron, which has a narrow range of optimal concentrations in the nutrient solutions supplied to soilless crops. A frequent problem in soilless culture is the increase of the EC in the root zone, reaching higher levels than the salinity threshold value for the corresponding plant 12.

To optimize irrigation scheduling, the frequency of irrigation should be related to the energy input (solar radiation, heating) and suitable equipment should be used. The use of raw irrigation water to wash out salts from substrates is an erroneous practice, resulting in excessively high pH levels and nutrient imbalances in the root zone, unless rainwater is available. The composition of the nutrient solution in the root zone changes gradually, due mainly to selective ion uptake by the plants in accordance with their nutrient requirements. In periods of sufficient light intensity and rapid growth, the anion uptake usually exceeds that of cations, owing to elevated nitrate absorption and utilization in plant metabolism. In terms of electrochemical potential, anion uptake which exceeds that of cations is compensated for by the release of HCO3- and OH- by the roots. As a result, the pH of the nutrient solution in the rhizosphere increases. However, under poor light conditions, the nitrate reductase activity declines, thus imposing a depression in nitrate utilization by the plant and concomitantly lower NO3- uptake rates. Consequently, the total anion uptake is reduced. In terms of electrochemical potential, a more rapid uptake of cations than anions is compensated for by release of H+ from the roots. Hence, under poor light conditions, the root zone pH does not tend to increase rapidly, and in some cases it may even decrease. If the pH of the nutrient solution in the root zone drops below the optimal range, KOH, KHCO3 or K2CO3 may be used for its adjustment, injected from a separate stock solution tank to avoid phosphate and carbonate precipitation (Savvas, 2001). The control of pH in the root environment of soilless cultivated plants usually requires measures to prevent the occurrence of a too high, rather than a too low, pH. If the percentage of drainage solution is relatively low, increased irrigation frequency or water dosage at each irrigation cycle might restore normal pH levels within the root zone. If adjustment of the irrigation schedule fails to GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 330 bring the pH to normal levels, an increase in ammonium supply may be needed. Nitrogen is the only nutrient that can be supplied to plants via fertigation in both anionic (NO3-) and cationic (NH4+) forms, while the uptake rates of both N forms are influenced by their external concentrations. Thus, the manipulation of NH4-N/NO3-N in the supplied nutrient solution without altering the total-N concentration may considerably modify the total cation to anion uptake ratio. However, changes in this ratio have a profound impact on the pH of the root zone Indeed, the imbalance of total cation over anion uptake in the rhizosphere originating from enhanced NH4+ uptake (Figure 6) is electrochemically compensated for by the release of protons, which results in a lowering of the medium pH. Similarly, the excess of anion over cation uptake due to increased supply of NO3- is compensated for by H+ influx or equivalent anion extrusion, which increases the pH of the external solution. As a rule, the use of NH4+ as the sole or dominating N source impairs growth and restricts yield due to the high toxicity of ammonia at intracellular level. Therefore, the current recommendation for soilless culture is that NH4-N should not exceed 25 percent of the total nitrogen supply (Sonneveld, 2002), although individual species differ in their response to the NH4-N/total-N supply ratio and root zone pH. In soilless-grown crops of leafy vegetables, such as lettuce and rocket, a partial substitution of NH4+ for NO3- in the nutrient solution may restrict the accumulation of NO3-", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

FIGURE 6 Balance between the uptake of cations and anions by plants when the NH4-N/total-N in the supplied nutrient solution is high, thereby imposing a higher total cation uptake in comparison with that of anions Under these conditions, the pH in the root zone tends to decrease, because the difference between total cation and anion uptake by the plant is compensated for by release of H+ by the root cells to avoid imbalances of their electrochemical potential.

Soilless culture 331 Nutrient recycling in closed soilless culture systems In closed systems, the nutrient concentrations in the solution supplied to the crop are largely determined by the composition of the recycled drainage solution. However, it changes during the cropping period and hence its composition is unknown. The changes in the nutrient concentration of the drainage solution complicate its recycling, because the amounts of nutrients needed to establish the target concentrations in the solution supplied to the plants are uncertain. The problem is further complicated by the fact that in commercial horticulture the replenishment process must be performed automatically. To overcome this problem, various automation techniques involving measurements of drainage solution characteristics and adjustments in real time are used in modern closed- cycle soilless culture systems. A standard technique involves mixing of drainage and water at an automatically adjustable ratio by aiming at a preset EC in the outgoing mixture. This operation enables the maintenance of a constant, desired EC in the nutrient solution supplied to the crop by dispensing nutrients at standard injection rates to the mixture of drainage solution and water, despite any fluctuations in the composition of the drainage solution. Another approach is the injection of fertilizers into water at standard rates aimed at a preset EC and the subsequent mixing of the obtained solution with the effluents to be recycled. Also in the latter case, the mixing process is automatically adjusted in real time to a ratio resulting in a constant target EC in the outgoing irrigation solution. As stated above, both techniques are based on the injection of nutrients at standard rates, which are adjustable by the grower when the drainage solution is mixed with fertilizers and water prior to its resupply to the crop. If, for a particular crop species, experimentally established estimates of the mean uptake concentrations are known for all nutrients to be added in the nutrient solution, the rates of nutrient injection may be adjusted to equal levels with the anticipated uptake concentrations. Thus, as long as the system is closed, the rate of nutrient and water input into the closed system is equal to the rate of their removal due to plant uptake. Consequently, the supply of nutrients is adequate for optimal plant growth, but not excessive, and thus neither depletion nor accumulation of nutrients occurs in the closed system. Unfortunately, nutrient solution compositions corresponding to anticipated mean uptake concentrations, which can be used for balanced crop nutrition in closed soilless culture systems, are currently available only for the climatic conditions of the Netherlands (De Kreij et al., 1999). Hence, to optimize nutrient recycling in soilless culture in the Mediterranean region, there is a need to establish and validate estimates of the mean uptake concentrations for all nutrients under the specific climatic conditions. Long-term recycling of leachate solution may result in accumulation of sparingly absorbed ions, such as Na+ and Cl-.

However, reliable tools providing real-time monitoring of specific ion levels in the drainage solution are currently not available at prices affordable to the growers. Therefore, the standard practice for coping with salt accumulation in closed systems is currently the provisional suspension of recycling and the discharge of the drainage solution until its EC returns to acceptable levels. IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT IN SOILLESS CULTURE Irrigation management includes water transport to the root zone and the decisions “when” to irrigate the crops and “how much” to apply. Irrigation scheduling requires good knowledge of the crop’s water demand and the substrate’s physical properties. The efficiency of the irrigation method affects the precision of water application. Irrigation management is one of the main factors determining the overall performance of soilless culture systems, since both nutrients and water are supplied to the root zone via the irrigation system. One of the most important advantages of soilless culture compared with soil-grown cultures is the accurate control of water availability in the root zone. Moreover, soilless culture systems greatly improve water-use efficiency and water management in crop production. However these advantages depend on the equipment available and the system management because of the low buffering capacity in soilless culture systems. In soilless culture, the root zone volume is much smaller than in soil-based cropping systems and thus the total volume of available water per plant is smaller, despite the higher water-holding capacity, lower moisture tension and greater hydraulic conductivity in most crops grown on substrates (Schröder and Lieth, 2002). Smaller root volume results in restricted root length and surface area and, therefore, limited capacity of the plant to take up nutrients and water. Therefore “little and frequent” irrigation and fertilization is applied to maximize yield. A standard recommendation in soilless culture is to apply a constant volume of irrigation water at each irrigation event and vary the number of irrigation applications (as opposed to keeping the number of irrigation events constant and varying the volume of irrigation water). Some growing media may be characterized by a high water-holding capacity accompanied by suboptimal air capacity, while other media may exhibit high air capacity accompanied by suboptimal water availability. In the first case, less frequent irrigation in combination with higher watering dosages is the most appropriate strategy, while the opposite is recommended in the second case. As a general rule, the application of a specialized irrigation schedule for each growing medium, taking into consideration the physical properties, may mitigate problems relating to poor aeration or limited water availability. 12. Soilless culture 333 Characteristics of irrigation systems Various types of irrigation system are used, depending mainly on the soilless culture system applied in each case. In most cases, there is more than one irrigation circuit or sector in one greenhouse aimed at reducing the necessary output capacity of the irrigation pump. System design should aim to maximize irrigation performance by optimizing all design characteristics, including system capacity, uniformity, storage capacity, pumping capacity, delivery systems, management of drainage, production unit and automation control systems. Capacity System capacity is the maximum flow rate that can be delivered through a particular irrigation system. It is related to the volume of water applied through each circuit and the duration of each irrigation event. Uniformity Uniformity is important when the irrigation water is supplied through a large number of emitters, especially when each plant receives nutrient solution through an individual emitter. Even if the capacity of the system is sufficient to cover the total water and nutrient requirements of a crop, some plants may receive insufficient amounts of nutrient solution while other plants may be overirrigated if the variation", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

It is related to the volume of water applied through each circuit and the duration of each irrigation event. Uniformity Uniformity is important when the irrigation water is supplied through a large number of emitters, especially when each plant receives nutrient solution through an individual emitter. Even if the capacity of the system is sufficient to cover the total water and nutrient requirements of a crop, some plants may receive insufficient amounts of nutrient solution while other plants may be overirrigated if the variation in flow rate among the emitters is very high. The variation in flow rate among individual emitters determines the uniformity of the system. Uniformity is key to the designing of irrigation systems. The uniformity of an irrigation system can be quantitatively estimated by calculating the coefficient of uniformity (Q) using Equation 2: Eq. 2 where: xi is the water supply rate in the ith of the n sample plants A is the mean water supply rate to the particular plants The coefficient of uniformity is a dimensionless quantity, independent of the water supply rate with a range of 0–1. The higher the coefficient of uniformity, the more uniform the distribution of water to the plants. Irrigation uniformity can be increased by minimizing the pressure drop in the system and pressure variation among the emitters. In order to distribute the nutrient solution uniformly in soilless-grown crops, well-designed and well-maintained irrigation systems should be established. The uniformity of an irrigation system decreases over time, due to partial or complete clogging of emitters. Storage capacity A storage tank or reservoir is required to supply irrigation water to the plants. The necessary volume of the storage tank depends on the size of the growing system, 𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄= 1 − ∑ |𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴| 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 334 namely number and type of plants and their water demand when they reach maximum size under maximum evapotranspiration conditions. A storage tank is anticipated to have sufficient capacity to supply irrigation water for at least one day to all plants. A high storage capacity minimizes the risk of crop damage due to failures in the primary water supply system. Pumping capacity The pumping capacity needed depends on the size and type of the irrigation system, number of irrigation zones, crop species, water requirement and extent of each circuit. It is important for the grower to know the maximum potential demand for irrigation water and the pumping capacity required to satisfy this, even in a worst-case scenario (Schröder and Lieth, 2002). Soilless culture systems have small root zone buffering and, therefore, the plants need more frequent irrigation, which entails short intervals between irrigation events. Overall, irrigation timing and duration is related to environmental conditions, cultivated plant species and growth stage. Delivery systems Irrigation systems can be grouped according to the method of water delivering to the plant, namely overhead (above the plant), drip irrigation (at the substrate surface) or subirrigation (below the root zone). Solenoid valves are used to automatically control irrigation. If no substrate is used or the substrate has limited water-holding capacity, continuous supply of nutrient solution in closed-loop circuits enabling capture and reuse of the effluents is appropriate. In such systems, there is no need to define when to irrigate and how much water will be applied, since the roots are either constantly immersed in a continuously flowing nutrient solution (i.e. NFT) or frequently sprayed with nutrient solution (e.g. aeroponics). Overhead systems Water or nutrient solution is applied directly to the shoot from above. The use of overhead irrigation systems (e.g. the so-called “boom system”) is very common in nurseries for seedling and pot plant production (Plate 15). A boom system consists of a rig that moves above the plants by means of a rail. An irrigation pipe equipped with nozzles at standard intervals is fixed on the rig.

Drip irrigation Drip irrigation is the most widely used system in soilless culture due to its high precision and uniformity, resulting in highly efficient water use. Water is delivered slowly to the roots either on the substrate surface or directly to the root zone. A drip irrigation system consists of one or more pumps, non-return valves, dilution equipment, filters, pressure regulators, water meters, mainline, submainlines, lateral pipes and emitters. The pump should be selected according to maximum expected flow rate and pressure. Filters are used to prevent clogging, and pressure regulators are important to provide uniform pressure in the system. Various emitters are available in a wide range of shapes and flow rates. Pressure-compensating emitters which deliver a constant amount of water per unit of time regardless of changes in pressure are a recently developed technology. Emitters should be selected on the basis of their advantages and disadvantages and their specific suitability for each type of soilless cultivation system (Table 3). The flow rate suggested for each emitter ranges between 1 and 4 litres per hour, depending on the cultivated plant species, soilless culture type and irrigation system capacity. Various emitters are available to provide this range of flow rate and most are designed to operate at a supply pressure of 0.2–1 bar. Substrate particle size also affects water availability and needs to be taken into consideration in the selection of emitters. For example, in a substrate with large particles, the use of low density emitters with high flow capacity results in a more vertical movement, while high density emitters with a low flow capacity causes more horizontal flow, which is desirable (Schröder and Lieth, 2002). Overhead systems Advantages: • Relatively low installation cost • Applicability in large areas • Cooling effect Disadvantages: • Waste of water due to unused runoff • Disease incidence risk • Residue risk on leaves and flowers • Inefficient water use in substrate culture resulting in lower WUE • Wetting the surrounding area of the plant Drip irrigation Advantages: • Individual irrigation of each plant • Efficient water use • Precision • Uniformity • Less runoff • Less evaporation Disadvantages: • Emitter clogging • Difficulty in evaluating system operation and application uniformity • Substrate/application rate interaction • Persistent maintenance requirements • Smaller wetting pattern GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 336 The spaghetti or tube system has a small diameter tube connected at the side. The system can be used with or without emitters. Since each plant has its own tube, it is more suitable for pot plants and containers. Pressure fluctuation could be prevented by using pressure-compensating emitters. Subirrigation In subirrigated soilless cultivations, nutrient solution is applied from the base and moves up through the root zone by capillary forces – it could be called “plant- driven irrigation”. These systems consist of capillary mats, trough benches, ebb and flow systems, flooded floors (Lieth and Oki, 2008) and auto-pots® (Fah, 2000) (Table 4) (Figure 7). In a standard subirrigation system, the nutrient solution is pumped from the fertigation head to the upper end of the crop benches, released into the troughs TABLE 4 Categories of subirrigated systems, advantages and disadvantages, and their suitability for different soilless culture systems System Advantages Disadvantages Crop grown Capillary mats Easy, cost effective Needs good ground levelling Pot plants Troughs Different amount for different plant groups If system not closed, waste of water Pot plants, vegetables grown on substrates Ebb and flow system Easy to use; uniformity Substrate and water depth interaction; if recycling applied, spread of pathogens Young plants, vegetables Flooded floors Larger scale Needs proper design and installation; sanitation Seedling production, big ornamental plants Auto-pots® No leaching of nutrients and water; no electricity- driven devices; low cost Salt accumulation in the upper part; needs smart valves for capillary action Vegetables, short cycle crops TABLE 3 Categories of emitters, advantages and disadvantages, and their suitability for different soilless growing systems Emitter Advantages Disadvantages Growing system Porous pipe Easy, low cost Irregularity among the pores, no internal water pressure control Surface or subirrigation systems Punch-in emitters - drip", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Soilless culture 337 and allowed to run slowly down to the lower end of the trough where the excess drains out and returns to a catchment tank for recirculation. In most cases, the supply of nutrient solution is intermittent. The troughs are filled with a substrate with good capillary properties. For better drainage after each irrigation cycle, a coarse aggregate may be placed in the bottom of the trough. In auto-pot® systems, water and nutrients are supplied when a smart-valve is opened and the nutrient solution enters the bottom of the container to a predetermined and preset depth (usually 3.5 cm). The valve then closes, preventing further entry of nutrient solution until the original supply has been conveyed from the solution chamber to the pot and then to the plant. The solution reaches up to the higher layers of the pot and down to the root surface (essential for plant uptake) by capillary action thanks to the porosity of the substrate. Once the FIGURE 7 Auto-pot® and modified auto-pot systems Standard Operational Practices, Ecoponics; Meric et al., 2008 Nutrient tank Capillary rise Nutrient solution Automatic valves Filtration Capillary rise Nutrient solution Automatic valves Nutrient tank Filtration GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 338 solution is absorbed, the valve is reopened to supply water and nutrients to the containers (Fah, 2000). Most subirrigation systems do not discharge nutrient solution to the environment; they are superior to other systems in terms of water and fertilizer saving, uniformity of nutrition, labour efficiency and self-scheduling. Subirrigation is mainly applied in pot plant production, given the short growing cycle and low water and nutrient requirements. Its main disadvantage is root zone salinity resulting from application of the nutrient solution from the bottom and its upward movement in the bulk of the substrate, which does not permit salt leaching. One way of reducing salt buildup and its negative effects on plants in subirrigated systems is to supply nutrient solutions with lower macronutrient concentrations (Tuzel et al., 2007). Management of drainage Drained nutrient solution is discarded outside the greenhouses in open systems while it is collected and reused in closed systems. In open soilless culture systems, the drained solution can be used in open field crops instead of being released into the environment. In closed systems, the drainage solution is captured and recycled. However, the accumulation of some nutrients due to dissimilarities between the rates of nutrient supply and the rates of nutrient uptake results in ion imbalance. On the other hand, the risk of root disease spreading through the recycled nutrient solution is another important problem that should be considered. Use of sand filters or UV lamps can minimize the risk of pathogen dispersal through the recycled drainage solution but the additional cost has to be taken into account. Control systems There are different levels of irrigation control, from hand irrigation and simple clock timers to computer-based monitoring and control systems. With manual control, substrate selection (i.e. substrate with high water-holding capacity, good aeration and high hydraulic conductivity) is important to mitigate the impact grower error. Control parameters depend on crop species, growing stage, environmental conditions, system performance and management practices. Controls must be extremely dependable, and should have a signalling system if failure occurs.

Irrigation scheduling Irrigation scheduling approaches Irrigation scheduling is the decision related to “when” to irrigate and “how much” water to apply to the crop. It is based either on substrate water status, where the moisture content or potential is measured directly to determine the need for irrigation, or on plant water status, which does not indicate how much water to apply. The main advantages and disadvantages of the different irrigation 12. Soilless culture 339 scheduling approaches are summarized in Table 5 (Jones, 2004). However, not all these approaches are as yet used in soilless culture. In soilless culture, little and frequent irrigation is required. Thus, rapidly growing crops in the summer may need 15–20 or even more irrigation events a day. Increasing irrigation frequency reduces fruit defects, such as cracking and blossom end rot. To optimize synchronization of water supply to demand in soilless cultivated crops, frequency and rate of irrigation must be properly tuned. The quantity of supplied water is higher than anticipated plant consumption to TABLE 5 Main advantages and disadvantages of some irrigation scheduling approaches according to Jones (2004) Approach Advantages Disadvantages I. Substrate water status (root zone sensors) Directly measures matric potential and water content in root zone. Indicates plant status indirectly. a) Substrate water potential (i.e. tensiometers) Simple, easy to apply, quite precise, appropriate for automation. Needs many sensors and good contact with the substrate; position should be representative for root zone. b) Substrate water content (time domain reflectometer – TDR; frequency domain reflectometer – FDR) Simple, easy to apply, quite precise, appropriate for automation, measures root zone EC. FDR and TDR need calibration; position should be representative for the root zone; needs good contact with substrate; expensive. II. Plant water status Measures plant response to stress directly, integrates environmental conditions, potentially very sensitive. Does not indicate “how much” water to apply; calibration required to determine “control thresholds”; still little use in commercial greenhouses. a) Tissue water status Appropriate measurement for physiological processes (i.e. photosynthesis); particularly measures leaf water status. Sensitive to environmental conditions. i) Psychrometer (y) Valuable, thermodynamically based measure of water status; can be automated. Requires sophisticated equipment and high level of technical skill, unreliable in the long term. b) Physiological responses Potentially more sensitive than measuring tissue (especially leaf) water status. Require sophisticated or complex equipment; require calibration to determine “control thresholds”. i) Stomatal conductance Very sensitive response. Needs replications for reliable data. – Porometer Accurate: the benchmark for research studies. Needs labour (not automated); inappropriate for commercial crops. ii) Growth rate Very sensitive to stress. Instrumentation delicate and generally expensive. III. Model-based estimation of water needs using real-time measurements of climatic parameters Simple, sensitive, suitable for automation. Needs efficient calibration to specific crop species, crop growth stage and environmental conditions. Accuracy may be insufficient when cultivars or cultural practices are not those used for calibration. Some coefficients are based on poorly applicable simplifications in commercial greenhouses. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 340 compensate for lack of uniformity in supply rate among emitters and to prevent salt accumulation in the root zone. The volume ratio of drained solution to water applied is called leaching fraction. In open soilless culture systems, the leaching fraction should not exceed 25–35 percent to minimize discharge of fertilizer residues to the environment, but in closed systems, drainage water is reused and irrigation frequency can be much higher than in open cultivation systems. Frequent irrigation resulting in high leaching fractions in closed soilless culture systems can delay salt accumulation rate in the root zone, enhance yield and improve fruit quality without any environmental impact. The only precaution regarding the application of a frequent irrigation schedule is the possible creation of excessive moisture conditions in the root zone that might reduce oxygen availability (Schröder and Lieth, 2002). Nevertheless, this problem may be tackled by selecting growing media with optimal physical characteristics in combination with proper placement of the media in the hydroponic installation.

Irrigation decisions Generally, common approaches in irrigation decisions entail timer-based, sensor- based or model-based irrigation control methods. • Electrical timers specifically designed to control irrigation valves are used. This operation is the cheapest, simplest and easiest approach for triggering irrigation events. However, time-based irrigation needs skilled personnel and knowledge to compile a present irrigation schedule. • Sensor-based control depends on the measurement of the water status either in the substrate (i.e. tensiometer, frequency domain reflectometer) or in the plant (i.e. sap flow meter, thermal sensing) (Table 5). • Model-based control is based on the estimation of plant water loss related to one or more environmental variables (i.e. temperature, solar radiation). Scheduling is computerized to obtain in real time crop irrigation needs based on the data provided online by sensors. Many methods are available for the estimation of evapotranspiration and most of them use either a modified version or a combination of models originally developed by Penman and Monteith. However, the application of these models in commercial practice needs appropriate calibration for each crop. Impact of irrigation on yield and quality Freshness and appearance, including fruit or organ size, colour and the occurrence of physiological disorders (e.g. cracking and blossom end rot, BER, in tomatoes and peppers, and tip burn in lettuce) are directly or indirectly influenced by water availability and quality, and watering frequency. Controlled watering could be used to balance vegetative growth with generative development in fruiting vegetables and to regulate fruit size (e.g. in tomatoes). Generally, increasing water availability enhances fruit size and acidity in tomato. On the contrary, 12. Soilless culture 341 deficit irrigation enhances fruit desirability in terms of dry matter content, total soluble solids, sugar and colour intensity. Fruit sugars become concentrated under conditions of reduced water supply. However, the problem of BER is difficult to solve since the conditions contributing to increased dry matter and sugar concentrations also favour this disorder. Calcium spraying on the fruit cluster or improving environmental conditions (Gruda, 2005) are possible solutions. Water shortage can increase the content of health-promoting substances. Water availability and irrigation timing may also influence the flavour of vegetables. Overall, water shortage generally tends to increase the ascorbic acid content in fruit; increasing the water supply reduces lycopene, ß-carotene, vitamins and minerals, as well as total antioxidant capacity. High yields do not automatically imply high quality, therefore, a compromise needs to be established (Gruda, 2009). SOILLESS CULTIVATION OF MAJOR GREENHOUSE VEGETABLE CROPS The soilless cultivation specifics of the major vegetables cultivated commercially in Mediterranean greenhouses are given below, including most used systems, layout, crop nutritional requirements and other special needs. The crops are divided into two groups: fruiting vegetables and once over-harvested vegetables. For each vegetable species, recommended nutrient concentrations in nutrient solutions are given (Savvas, 2012), based on Dutch recommendations (Sonneveld and Straver, 1994; De Kreij et al., 1999) modified on the basis of mostly unpublished experimental data to adapt to Mediterranean climatic conditions. In addition to the nutrient concentrations recommended for open soilless crops of tomato grown on inert substrates, nutrient solutions for closed soilless cultivations are given, as well as target nutrient concentrations for the root zone. The recommended EC values are valid for NaCl concentrations up to 1.5 mmol litre-1 in the irrigation water. If Na+ and Cl- exceed this level in the irrigation water, the target EC has to be increased accordingly, taking into account that 1 mmol litre-1 of NaCl raises the EC by 0.115 dS m-1 (Sonneveld, 2002). Fruiting vegetables This category includes tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, eggplant, melon and bean. The general characteristic of this group is the long cropping period, 1–3 plantings per year and a small number of plants per m2 (about 1–6), arranged in 2–4 rows per 3.2- or 4-m span (van Os et al., 2008). Fruiting plants are characterized by a complex crop physiology, since the vegetative growth and flowering as well as the fruiting phases overlap and need to be simultaneously and continually balanced.

Fruiting plants are characterized by a complex crop physiology, since the vegetative growth and flowering as well as the fruiting phases overlap and need to be simultaneously and continually balanced. Young plants are raised in blocks and planted either on substrates supplied regularly with nutrient solution or directly in pure nutrient solution when liquid hydroponic systems are employed. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 342 Tomato Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is the most important greenhouse crop grown in soilless cultivation systems. The need to obtain high yields of high quality while considering environmental issues puts increased pressure on greenhouse tomato growers. Soilless culture systems are sustainable while increasing the net income per invested square metre; in addition, today’s varieties allow growers to use a wide range of new fresh tomato types. The aim is to produce greenhouse tomatoes in periods when outdoor production is not available or competitive, thereby achieving premium-priced production with high quality and good-tasting fruit. The most widely used soilless culture system for tomato production is cultivation on rockwool slabs wrapped in polyethylene bags and supplied with nutrient solution through a drip irrigation system. Other local substrates, such as perlite, pumice and tuff, are also used, whereas the NFT-system is not very common in the Mediterranean area, although it is generally considered to be a commercially viable form of water culture with ecological benefits. In soilless culture, tomato can tolerate total salt concentrations of up to 2.5–2.9 dS m-1 in the root zone without yield losses (Sonneveld and Voogt, 2009). However, in most cases, growers maintain higher EC levels than the STV in the root zone of soilless-grown tomato in order to improve fruit quality in terms of organic acidity and soluble solid (Gruda, 2009). The increase of EC to higher values than the STV in order to improve fruit quality is economically beneficial despite the concomitant yield losses because of the relatively low rate of tomato yield decrease per unit of EC increase above the STV (Sonneveld and Voogt, 2009). Under Mediterranean conditions, EC values of up to 3.5 dS m-1 in the root zone are recommended for soilless tomato in order to achieve premium fruit quality. In north European countries, even higher EC values of up to 5 dS m-1 are maintained, particularly under cold and cloudy weather conditions. Nevertheless, the EC of the nutrient solution in the root zone of tomato grown in Mediterranean greenhouses has to be reduced to levels lower than 3 dS m-1 under hot summer conditions. In addition to the EC adjustment in the root zone, Gruda (2009) reported several other ways to improve product quality by proper design and operation of soilless culture systems. Furthermore, a review of recent research relevant to the impact of tomato nutrition on fruit quality was written by Passam et al. (2007). A crucial factor for tomato nutrition in soilless culture is the N:K ratio in the nutrient solution. Adams and Massey (1984) found that the mean daily N:K uptake ratios were 2.40 and 2.25 on a molar basis prior to setting of fruit in the first truss of tomato in February and August, respectively. However, this ratio decreased to 1.12 (molar basis) when the fruit load increased, followed by a slight increase to 1.40 after some weeks. Another important characteristic of the nutrient solution supplied to tomatoes is the NH4-N/total-N ratio. As reported by Sonneveld (2002), both growth and yield of tomato are enhanced when a small part of N ranging from 5 percent to less than 15 percent of total N is supplied in the form of 12. Soilless culture 343 NH4+. Tomato is tolerant to moderately high pH but susceptible to low pH levels in the root environment, due mainly to impairment of the Ca uptake (Savvas et al., 2008). With respect to the macronutrient cations, the K requirements increase with fruit load, while Ca requirements decrease (De Kreij et al., 1999). However, the Ca levels in the supplied nutrient solutions should be maintained at relatively high levels during the reproductive phase of the crop to minimize the incidence of BER.

Recommended nutrient solution concentrations for tomato are given in Table 6. Cucumber Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a semi-tropical plant originating in India and the second most important greenhouse soilless-grown crop. In Greece, Turkey, Egypt and other Mediterranean countries, a short-fruit cucumber is widely grown and is very popular in local markets. However, the most common cucumbers grown today in soilless greenhouses are the long, seedless type. Cucumber can be grown in different seasons and many growers in Mediterranean countries prefer to plant two or three crops per year instead of a single, year-round crop (standard practice in the Netherlands). After termination of the first crop, plants with roots are only partially removed and cut out from the substrate with a knife. The young plants of the second set can then be inserted with a small amount of fresh substrate, if they are grown on granular substrates. After transplanting, adequate irrigation is essential for continuous growth.

Savvas, 2012 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 344 Cultivation in rockwool is very common. However, other local growing media (e.g. perlite, pumice) are also used. Slabs or bags with a width of either 15 or 30 cm are employed. Since no differences in cucumber yield were found when slabs of different width were used, it is recommended to use either single-row slabs (15 cm) or double-row slabs (20–30 cm). In the latter case, the plants have to be supported by applying a V-training system. Cucumber is a salt-sensitive plant species; the EC in the root-zone solution should ideally be maintained at 2.7 dS m-1, and in any case it should not exceed 3 dS m-1 in Mediterranean greenhouses, otherwise significant yield losses are inevitable (Sonneveld and Voogt, 2009). In Mediterranean greenhouses, EC values of 2.5 dS m-1 should be maintained during early plant growth, and adjusted to 2.7 dS m-1 with increasing plant size (Savvas, 2012). The recommended pH level in the root zone of cucumber is 5.3–6.4 and this can be achieved by including about 10 percent of the total N in the form of NH4-N in the solution. The literature provides recommended compositions of nutrient solutions for soilless cucumber (Papadopoulos, 1994; Sonneveld and Straver, 1994; De Kreij et al., 1999; Sonneveld and Voogt, 2009), but these recommendations are based on research carried out under cold-winter climatic conditions. Recommended nutrient concentrations for cucumber in Mediterranean climatic conditions are given in Table 7.

Savvas, 2012 12. Soilless culture 345 Since cucumber likes high levels of relative humidity, irrigation becomes critical at low relative humidity, because large quantities of water must be added to the growth medium without constantly flooding the roots and depriving them of oxygen. By using NFT systems or other water culture systems, additional means to improve oxygenation of the nutrient solution have to be considered (Papadopoulos, 1994). Pepper Bell or sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is the third most important soilless cultivated crop species. Bell pepper is cultivated in different growing systems and different substrates. Pepper plants can be trellised following either the Dutch “V” (a two-stem pruned) system or the “Spanish” (non-pruned) system. Jovicich et al. (2004) compared the “V” with the “Spanish” trellis system and found no differences in total marketable fruit yield. However, the non-pruned plants produced 38 percent more extra-large fruit and less fruit with BER at the end of the spring than the pruned plants. In addition, the labour requirement for the Spanish system was reduced to 25 percent that needed for the “V” trellis system. The authors recommend a plant density of 3.8 plants m-2. Pepper plants should be fertigated frequently with an appropriate nutrient solution. The suggested pH in the root zone during the harvesting period is 6–6.7, attainable by supplying about 5 percent of the total N in the form of NH4-N. A higher NH4-N supply during the reproductive phase is not recommended because ammonium may reduce the Ca uptake and increase the incidence of fruit with BER, to which pepper is highly susceptible. Pepper is considered a sensitive crop to salinity and the recommended EC range in the root zone is 2.7–3.0 dS m-1, depending on the season of the year and the mineral composition of the available irrigation water. Detailed information on single nutrient elements and physiological disorders of greenhouse pepper, including soilless culture, can be found in a recent review by Savvas et al. (2008). Recommended nutrient solutions for open and closed soilless pepper crops in Mediterranean countries are given in Table 8. Eggplant Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is an important greenhouse crop in most Mediterranean countries. Eggplant can be grown successfully in most commercial soilless culture systems, including cultivation in substrates and nutrient solution. When 1-m-long slabs or bags are used, two eggplant seedlings per slab or bag are usually planted. Denser spacing is not recommended because eggplant’s very large leaves may adversely affect light interception in the canopy and favour the occurrence of plant diseases. As a rule, each plant is trained to 2 or 3 stems, aiming at 4–6 stems m-2.

Overall, the nutrient requirements of eggplant exhibit many similarities with those of tomato. The only important differences are eggplant’s higher requirements of Mg and B and its lower requirements of K. However, the salt tolerance of eggplant is much lower than that of tomato and similar to that of pepper. Accordingly, the suggested EC in the root-zone solution of soilless eggplant grown in Mediterranean greenhouses ranges from 2.6 to 2.8 dS m-1. Nevertheless, values up to 3.0 dS m-1 may be inevitable if the NaCl concentration in the available irrigation water exceeds a level of about 3.0 mM. Recommended nutrient solutions for soilless cultivations of eggplant grown under Dutch greenhouse conditions have been published by Sonneveld and Straver (1994) and De Kreij et al. (1999). Table 9 gives the nutrient solution compositions for eggplants grown in Mediterranean countries. Melon It is possible to cultivate two or three cropping cycles of melon (Cucumis melo L.) per year in substrates, such as rockwool, perlite, pumice and tuff, as well as in NFT.

Savvas, 2012 12. Soilless culture 347 flowers and laterals should be removed up to the eighth node on the main stem. One fruit is then allowed to form on each lateral. In order to improve fruit setting, melons are often pollinated by bumblebees. Rodriguez et al. (2006) successfully grew melons in containers filled with different substrates and supplied with a nutrient solution composed as follows (mg per litre): 50 N, 23 P, 44 K, 5 Mg, 0.2 B, 0.5 Cu, 0.1 Fe, 0.5 Mn, 0.005 Mo and 0.005 Zn. Based on practical experience and some preliminary research results, Savvas (2012) suggests a nutrient solution with an EC of 2.2 dS m-1 and the following nutrient concentrations for melon grown in Mediterranean greenhouses: 6.8 mM K+, 4.0 mM Ca2+, 1.6 mM Mg2+, 1.1 mM NH4+, 13.2 mM NO3-, 1.2 mM H2PO4-, 2.1 mM SO42-, 10 µM Fe, 10 µM Mn, 5 µM Zn, 0.8 µM Cu, 20 µM B, and 0.5 µM Mo. The recommended EC in the root zone of soilless melon crops is 2.9 dS m-1, but values of up to 3.2 dS m-1, particularly during fruit ripening, may be beneficial in terms of fruit quality. Zucchini Zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) is an important plant in many Mediterranean countries for out-of-season greenhouse production and is successfully cultivated in soilless culture systems.

In contrast, the B requirements of zucchini are lower than those of cucumber. Furthermore, as with cucumber, the supply of Si through the nutrient solution is beneficial for zucchini, particularly when plants are exposed to salinity and other types of abiotic stress, or when there is a risk of powdery mildew attacks. Zucchini squash was found to be moderately sensitive to salinity under Mediterranean climatic conditions (Rouphael et al., 2006). Accordingly, EC values in the root-zone solution ranging from 2.6 to 2.8 dS m-1 are considered optimal for soilless zucchini squash grown in Mediterranean greenhouses. Nevertheless, if the concentrations of Na, Cl, and/or Ca in the available irrigation water are substantially higher than the optimal levels, an accordingly higher EC in the root zone of zucchini squash must be accepted to avoid shortages in nutrient supply. Nutrient solution compositions for zucchini squash crops grown under Mediterranean climatic conditions are given in Table 10.

Savvas, 2012 Bean Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a fruiting vegetable and is cultivated in soilless culture systems. The recommended density is 10–14 plants m-2, when liquid hydroponic systems or substrate culture are applied. Plants can be supported either by plastic twine attached on a horizontal wire, similar to those used in greenhouse crops of other fruiting vegetables (e.g. tomatoes, cucumbers and pepper), or by stretching suitable nets along the planting lines. Bean is sensitive to salinity. Therefore, the recommended EC values for nutrient solutions supplied to hydroponically grown bean are relatively low (≤ 2 dS m-1). Furthermore, care should be taken to avoid accumulation of Na+ and Cl- ions in the root zone, especially when the nutrient solution is recycled. Given bean’s high sensitivity to salinity, the availability of good quality water is essential for cultivation in closed soilless culture systems. Low pH levels in the root zone have a negative impact on plant growth: the pH should never be allowed to fall below 5.5. To avoid excessively low pH in the root zone, the percentage of NH4-N/ total-N in nutrient solutions supplied to bean should be relatively low (< 10%). Recommended compositions of nutrient solutions for bean crops originating from Savvas (2012) are given in Table 11. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 350 Once over-harvested vegetables This category comprises leafy vegetables, such as lettuce, rocket and other salad crops, but also kohlrabi, endive, spinach etc. Literature sometimes categorizes crops as transplanted and sowing plants. The general characteristics are: • relatively high plant density per m2 (10–20 for lettuce, > 100 for spinach); and • short cultivation period (1–4 months). Common practice is to raise seedlings in pressed peat cubes or pots or in mineral wool cubes. At present, only a small number of enterprises produce leafy vegetables in soilless culture systems in Europe, due to the tough competition from outdoor production and the relatively high investment needed; the economic efficiency is thus questioned (Van Os et al., 2008). Lettuce Due to its very short cultivation period, lettuce can be produced in more than eight cropping cycles per year in greenhouses, when grown hydroponically. For soilless cultivation of lettuce, float systems and systems based on continuous nutrient solution recirculation (e.g. NFT) are widespread; cultivation on substrates is less common. Lettuce is characterized by high K and P uptake rates, but is susceptible to Mn toxicity. It is crucial to maintain low nitrate content in the edible tissues: with soilless culture systems it is possible to properly adjust the supply of nitrates via the nutrient solution shortly before harvesting (Schnitzler and Gruda, 2002).

Savvas, 2012 12. Soilless culture 351 nutrients in nutrient solutions for lettuce crops grown in open and closed soilless systems as well as the target concentrations in the root zone. Other edible crops In general, it is possible to produce several other edible crops in soilless culture systems, but the cultivated area in Mediterranean countries is not extensive and, consequently, experience with such plants is limited. Nevertheless, some crops (e.g. kohlrabi, radish, endive, spinach, rocket and lamb’s lettuces) are successfully produced in this area as well. The most common methods are similar to those applied for lettuce production: flat hydroponic systems, float systems and NFT. The suggested EC level is lower in comparison to lettuce (about 1.3 and 1.6 dS m-1 for kohlrabi and lamb’s lettuces, respectively). However, the Fe content in the nutrient solution should be higher than that suggested for lettuce, particularly in lamb’s lettuce crops. Values of 4 mg per litre of Fe are, therefore, recommended (Göhler and Molitor, 2002). OUTLOOK Although in recent decades numerous scientific papers have addressed various aspects of soilless cultivation under Mediterranean climatic conditions, only a few have focused on the systematic determination of nutrient uptake. Thus, the currently available research data are still incomplete for the establishment of nutrient solution recipes, specifically for Mediterranean climatic conditions. Accordingly, more research is needed in the near future to estimate nutrient and water requirements of soilless cultivated plants under mild winter and dry summer conditions, such as those prevailing in the Mediterranean Basin. Such data would be particularly useful for establishing nutrient solution compositions for closed or semi-closed soilless crops (Savvas, 2002), where accuracy in nutrient-to-water supply ratios is much more important than in open systems for minimizing both ion accumulation in the root zone and discharge of drainage solution.

Good propagation capacity must develop together with expanding greenhouse crop production. Some farmers grow their own transplants, while others purchase them from a specialized nursery. When and where to get planting materials must be identified before planning greenhouse production. Proximity to nurseries which might supply transplants is a factor in the site selection of greenhouse production facilities: a long distance from the supplier may preclude the purchasing of transplants. The supply of planting materials (seeds and transplants) must be precisely scheduled for each production cycle. Good coordination skills are required to effectively work with nurseries, especially commercial nurseries, as timing of production and timely delivery of transplants are critical. Whether transplants are produced in-house or purchased from commercial nurseries, care must be taken to follow good agricultural practices to avoid introducing diseases and pests to the production greenhouse through seeds and transplants. A good transplant is usually defined by the grower’s specifications. According to the grower’s preferences, different management techniques may be required. For example, home gardeners may favour robust, succulent plants, while commercial farmers may select more hardened plants. No simple procedure can be followed in growing vegetable transplants, and only through experience can you begin to produce a consistent product. In general, vegetable transplants should be stocky, green and pest-free with a well-developed root system. Once transplanted, they should tolerate environmental challenges and continue growing to achieve optimum yield. Overly hardened or underfertilized transplants may not establish quickly, resulting in delayed maturity and reduced yields. Insufficiently hardened or over-fertilized plants may succumb to disease or abiotic stresses. The ideal technique for growing transplants is to raise the plant from start to finish by slow, steady, uninterrupted growth and with minimal stress. Since ideal growing conditions rarely exist, plant growth needs to be controlled through the manipulation of water, temperature and fertilizer. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 356 SEEDS Potential seed problems are: unexpected low germination rate, contamination with different species and introduction of seed-borne diseases. For example, bacterial canker of tomato (Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis) is a notorious seed-borne pathogen and outbreaks occur annually in tomato production areas worldwide (ASTA, 2009). For early detection, attention must be paid to the seed source as well as to the seedlings during propagation. Seed source • Keep records with key information: purchase date, source (vendor name), variety name, seed lot number, seed treatments and other seed quality parameters. • Test the germination rate before planting: it is recommended to follow the standardized protocol used by the country’s organization relevant to seed quality and trade; the germination rate must be recorded and kept with the other seed-related information for potential future track-back needs. • Use seeds from a reliable source: this is the only way to avoid unintentionally buying adulterated or “fake” seeds or improperly disinfested (therefore contaminated) seeds. • For genetically modified organisms, follow the relevant national or international regulations. Handling seeds Seed storage Understand seed type. Seeds may be classified according to their tolerance level to drying or temperature: orthodox, recalcitrant and intermediate. Most greenhouse- grown species produce orthodox seeds. However, under similar storage and harvest conditions, seeds exhibit different inherent longevities depending on the species (Walters and Towill, 2004). Relative life expectancy under favourable storage conditions for certain crop groups is: legumes (beans) 3–4 years; crucifers (broccoli, cauliflower) 4–5 years; lettuce, endive and chicory 4–5 years; spinach, beets, carrots and chard 2–3 years; cucurbits (melons, squash) 4–5 years; tomatoes 4 years; peppers 2 years; onion, parsley, parsnip and salsify 1 year. As seeds age, the germination percentage declines at varying rates depending on conditions and species. Guidelines for storage behaviour (orthodox vs recalcitrant) are presented in Table 1. Store unused seeds following recommendations from the seed source. In general, orthodox seeds should be stored in dark, dry and low temperature environments, kept in a tight container to avoid moisture. When old seeds are used, a germination test must be performed to verify the germination rate; their viability depends on the type of crop.

Therefore, the longer the seed storage period, the more important that the seed moisture content is low, and that the temperature is also low. The optimum storage humidity conditions and moisture content of seeds of some greenhouse-grown crop species are shown in Table 2.

Seed priming can improve germination and emergence, resulting in better uniformity; indeed, seeds of some species are almost always primed, as germination is poor without. Pelletizing seeds produces better uniformity and improves handling in automated seeders. Germination • Keep germination facilities clean and free from algae and pests. • Select conditions optimal for the crop species, thus improving uniformity and minimizing the time, reducing the overall costs for producing transplants. • Some species require oscillating temperature: eggplant and their rootstocks torvum generally germinate faster under day-night oscillating temperature conditions. • Monitor the media (not air) temperature during germination and control it in the optimum range; evaporation from wet media can reduce the temperature to a few degrees below the air temperature. GAPs for obtaining and handling seeds • Keep records of key information. • Test germination rate before planting. • Use seeds from a reliable source. • For genetically modified organisms, follow the relevant national or international regulations. • Understand seed type for storage and store unused seeds following recommendations from the seed source. • Avoid using seeds stored beyond the expected storage life. • Work with seed companies regarding the available options on seed treatments. • Keep germination facilities clean and free from algae and pests. • Select germination conditions optimal for the crop species. • Monitor the media temperature (not air temperature) during germination and control it in the optimum range. 13.

Organizational separation of transplant production from final crop production is a recent worldwide trend, especially for vegetable and floriculture/ornamental crops requiring special techniques, such as grafting or vegetative propagation, and specific facilities to produce desirable transplants (Plates 1 and 2). It is cheaper to buy such transplants than to produce them in-house, considering all the specialized facilities and skill-sets required. The decision needs to be made by each individual operation, considering all the relevant issues and cost analyses. When commercial nurseries are not available, or purchasing transplants is not economically advantageous, growers choose to produce their own transplants using their own facilities. Environmental conditions and fertilizer requirements are often specific to transplant production. Transplants are often produced by a short cycle, and growth and development are subject to weather conditions. Good production planning is necessary to coordinate with the final crop production. Records should be kept, including seeding date, variety name, substrate name, tray type, chemicals applied etc. It is important to avoid wetting foliage. Subirrigation works better than overhead irrigation if the facility is available. If overhead irrigation is the only Plate 1 Tomato transplants ready for shipping Plate 2 Tomato grafting operation in Spain (Almería) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 360 option, it is recommended to allow foliage to dry before the sun sets, as prolonged leaf wetness can lead to increased disease development (ASTA, 2009). Inspections should be carried out to identify signs of diseases and pests. If plants exhibit signs of infection, they must be discarded or an appropriate control method applied. Grafted seedlings Grafting is widely applied in vegetable production. In some countries, the technology is relatively new and care must be taken to avoid failure or transmission of diseases during the grafting process. • Keep grafting tools (razorblade, grafting tubes etc.) and working area clean with regular disinfestation. According to ASTA (2009), ethanol (70–75%) and other disinfectants are suitable for disinfecting cutting tools and hands, which should then be rinsed with clean water to avoid damage to the plant from residual disinfectant. Both disinfectants and rinsing water should be changed regularly. • Choose the rootstock on the basis of the specific problems to be solved by grafting and the grafting compatibility between scion and rootstock. Seed companies have information on expected phenotypes including disease resistance, but it is recommended to test any new scion-rootstock combination on a small scale before starting propagation on a large scale. Table 3 presents guidelines for selecting rootstocks. TABLE 3 Guidelines for selecting grafting rootstocks Type Resistance Other traits Tomato Interspecific hybrid (hybrid between different tomato species, e.g. ‘Maxifort’, Solanum lycopersicum x S. habrochaitaes) Different for different roostock varieties but generally include Fusarium, Verticillium wilt, root knot nematodes. Some include bacterial wilt and higher race (race 3) of Fusarium. Generally vigorous. Some rootstocks have chilling tolerance. However, less uniformity in plant growth at the seedling stage (germination and emergency). Intraspecific hybrid (hybrid within the same cultivated tomato species, e.g. ‘Aloha’, Solanum lycopersicum) Different for different rootstock varieties but generally include Fusarium, Verticillium wilt, root knot nematodes. Some include bacterial wilt and higher race (race 3) of Fusarium. Very uniform growth. Less vigorous. Cucurbits Interspecific hybrid squash (hybrid between different squash species, e.g. ‘Tetsukabuto’, Cucurbita maxima x C. moschata) Fusarium.

When considering automated grafting, it is important to take into account the advantages (e.g. lower labour input) and challenges (high capital costs and limited flexibility in terms of size of plants or trays). • Prepare scion and rootstocks to reach optimum graftable stage at the same time. Depending on the grafting method and species to graft, grafting must be done at the optimum growth stage of scion and rootstock seedlings. Use of overgrown or too young seedlings beyond optimal ranges reduces the grafting success rate. Good propagators must pay attention to seed germination timing and growing conditions to produce scion and rootstock seedlings at an optimal stage for grafting. An example of a propagation timetable is shown in Figure 1. • Keep healing facilities clean and free from algae and pests. Healing conditions often include high humidity (nearly 100%) and warmth (28–29 °C) with lighting, conducive to the growth of algae and fungi and the rapid spread of disease. • Choose between two-headed and single-headed grafted seedlings. For tomato, two-headed seedlings (pinched to induce two lateral shoots) are widely used to reduce the number of plants needed per cultivation area. However, an inappropriate combination of scion and rootstock may reduce the yield when they are two-headed. A small test to determine growth and yield capacity of two-headed plants must be conducted before using them on a large scale. FIGURE 1 Example timetable for producing grafted tomato and cucurbit seedlings Duration varies depending on species and grafting method (18-24 days for tomato amd 7-14 days for cucurbits) Duration varies depending on species and grafting method (18-24 days for tomato amd 7-14 days for cucurbits) Seeding scion Seeding roostock Grafting Healing (5-7 days) Finishing transplants (2-3 weeks) Removal of grafted plants from healing chambers Shipping and final transplanting GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 362 Purchasing transplants from commercial nurseries • Use transplants from reliable nurseries. Long-distance transportation causes deterioration of transplant quality. Select nurseries not only for their propagation skills (product quality) but also for their proximity to the production site and the transportation methods used. • Upon receipt of transplants, inspect carefully for signs of disease or pests. On finding signs of infection of notorious diseases and pests that could spread in the greenhouse (e.g. bacterial canker or TYLCV for tomato, bacterial fruit blotch for cucurbits), discard all the transplants and disinfect any trays and bench surfaces with which they have come into contact. • Maintain records of any products used for controlling pests and diseases during the propagation period. • For genetically modified organisms, follow the relevant national or international regulations. • If possible, visit the nursery during the transplant production process, check the young plants and discuss the quality with the manager. Production scheduling In commercial propagation, production scheduling is critical to maximize profits. • Schedule backwards, starting from the target shipping (delivery) window determined by customers or final crop production schedule. The time required to reach the growth stage suitable for transplanting is largely dependent on the crop species, climate conditions (solar radiation, day and night air temperature, and CO2 concentration) and growing methods (substrate, fertilizer and tray types). Experience is required to forecast transplant finishing time. • Understand the different facility requirements for the various stages of transplant production. For standard transplants, there are several stages, such as germination, transplanting, hardening and shipping. For grafted seedlings, there may also be sorting, grafting, healing and pinching. It is first necessary GAPs specific to the grafting of seedlings • Keep grafting tools (razorblade, grafting tubes etc.) and working area clean. • Proceed with the disinfection of the grafting tools between each cut with ethanol (70–75%) or other suitable disinfectants. • Choose appropriate rootstock. • Choose optimum grafting method. • Prepare scion and rootstocks to reach optimum graftable stage at the same time. • Keep healing facilities clean and free from algae and pests. • Carefully decide whether to use two-headed or single-headed grafted seedlings. 13.

Quality of planting materials 363 to establish how many trays (flats) one germination room can hold and how many workers are available for grafting in a given week. • Understand two variables: crop time and production space. Scheduling production and analysing facility use associated with transplant production can be a complicated process comprising multiple variables. To better schedule crops and turns, nursery propagators must develop their own computerized spreadsheets to better understand the facility use in any given week of the production period. This capacity is extremely important when propagation involves multiple species and different finishing timings. Packing and transportation • Select the packing and transportation method. Transplants are best transported when packed in trays inside cardboard boxes or on racks in trailers, but some growers prefer to receive “pull-and-pack” seedlings to reduce transportation costs. In either case, packing to accommodate rough handling is necessary, especially when a commercial freight service is employed (Plate 3). • Avoid long distance transportation. Transplants should be transported over the shortest distance possible, to minimize costs as well as the damage associated with transportation. However, in some cases, such as grafted seedlings that are not widely available in some countries, transportation may be longer than the normal time for vegetable transplants. Normal transportation time is no longer than 10 hours. • Select the timing of transportation to minimize environmental stress. Once scheduled, select exact timing to avoid the risk of exposing transplants to extreme heat or cold. During summer, overnight or early in the morning is preferable to midday to avoid heat stress, especially when plants are transported in a non-refrigerated truck. In contrast, midday transportation is more desirable when freezing temperatures are expected at night. • Select the transportation route to minimize mechanical stress. Mechanical stress caused by vibration during transportation has a negative impact on the Plate 3 Rough transportation or handling of boxes could result in tumbled seedlings during transportation Plate 4 Ventilated truck used for transporting seedlings GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 364 transplants. It can physically damage the transplants or promote ethylene production. Ethylene accumulation can induce adverse physiological impacts such as flower abortion or leaf yellowing, especially during long distance transportation. • Use a refrigerated trailer at a controlled selected temperature for long distance transportation. Too high temperatures can produce adverse physiological effects such as flower abortion (Kubota and Kroggel, 2006). • Assure ventilation to avoid ethylene accumulation during transportation. Plate 4 shows a commercial nursery truck (non-refrigerated) designed for transporting transplants. This type of truck has some ventilation and is suitable for relatively short distances (no more than several hours). • Complete necessary importation paperwork for international shipping of transplants. • Do not transport plants if there is any sign of disease or virus infection. Introduction of viruses such as TYLCV is often associated with transportation of plant materials. Accidental introduction of infected plants following inappropriate judgment by a careless propagator could cause a catastrophic outbreak affecting the entire production region. FACILITIES AND MATERIALS TO GROW PLANTS The facilities and climate conditions for transplants are different from those for final crop production. Young seedlings are generally more sensitive to abiotic and biotic environmental stresses and a growing facility must be carefully selected in order to achieve optimum growing conditions. There are several production stages, and each one has specific recommendations with regard to environmental conditions, fertilization and plant maintenance methods. Production site selection The transplant production facility should be located at a distance from the farming area, which is a potential source of insects and diseases that can easily reach the transplant production facility. The site should be levelled and well drained with ready access to an abundant supply of quality water. The greenhouse should be positioned sufficiently far from surrounding trees or buildings so as to prevent shadows. Considerations concerning greenhouse location may be summarized as follows: • good drainage and water supply • sufficient distance from cultivation area • good proximity to shipping routes • easy access to utilities • local zoning for land use and tax laws • room for expansion and absence of", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Quality of planting materials 365 Seedling trays Seeds can be sown in a variety of ways (depending on their end use) in individual plant containers or plastic flats filled with various types of sterile growing media (substrates). Choose trays or containers suitable for the production (Plate 5). Criteria include plant species, growing conditions (irrigation method), local availability and type of mechanical seeder used. There are various containers and trays: • Individual containers may be more appropriate for foliage plants or mature seedlings (flowering stage) of vegetable species. They come in paper, plastic, clay, peat moss, Styrofoam (Plate 6) etc. • Individual plastic containers (called net pots or web pots) are used in floating or NFT hydroponic systems, filled with coarse substrates, such as perlite, clay pellets and rockwool. • Moulded plastic or Styrofoam “plug” or cavity (multi-celled) trays are available in various sizes containing tens to hundreds of cavities, and can be filled with growing medium or cubes for the production of multiple seedlings in each tray. Use steam or other disinfectants to sterilize reused trays. Plastic containers can be sterilized using 10 percent bleach, while Styrofoam containers and trays are steam-sterilized. In some countries in Europe, Styrofoam is recycled to be used for other purposes (Styer and Koranski, 1997). When disinfectant solution is used, soak the trays long enough to ensure efficacy; rinse containers thoroughly to avoid chemical toxicity; allow the trays to dry prior to use. Choose tray type and size adaptable to the mechanical seeder, transplanter and other greenhouse propagation systems (benches and irrigation systems). Test candidate trays for plant performance as plant growth is affected by type of trays (cell size, volume, colour etc.). Limit the maximum reuse of seedling trays (or plug trays) to 2–3 times. Styer and Koranski (1997) suggest that the cost of labour for washing, disinfecting, Plate 5 Seedling trays with various cell shapes and sizes Plate 6 Tomato seedlings grown in a Styrofoam tray GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 366 stacking and storing used trays almost equals the cost of new trays. Reuse also increases the risk of disease introduction resulting from incomplete disinfection. Substrate1 • Select a substrate and understand its physical properties. There are various substrates available for horticultural use (e.g. sand, peat, moss, vermiculite, perlite, rockwool, rice hulls, coconut coir, compost). In general, a substrate needs to have good air porosity and water-holding capacity. • Maintain the media pH in the optimum range (5.5–6.5 in general). Too high or too low pH can cause micronutrient deficiency or toxicity, respectively. • Keep the initial level of EC (electrical conductivity) below 0.75 dS/cm at a 2:1 (v:v) dilution (Styer and Koranski, 1997). Some substrates have fertilizers mixed in (known as “starter charge”) and the amount of starter charge needs to be taken into account in the fertilization schedule. • Use substrate from a reliable source. Organic substrates (e.g. coconut coir) are often inconsistent in quality and vary depending on the source and origins. Chemicals • Ensure that any chemicals used during propagation do not violate the regulations of the country where the plants are to be grown for production. • Use products from reliable sources. • Follow the application instructions on the product label; some chemicals require professional certificates for applicators (workers). • Keep records of product name, dose, application method, operator name, date and time of application etc. Fertilizers • Use products from a reliable source; avoid low quality fertilizers as they may contain contaminants such as heavy metal. • Keep good records when mixing fertilizers to make up stock nutrient solution. Record fertilizer product name, salt name, weighed amount, operator name, date and time etc. • Check EC and pH of nutrient solution regularly; EC and pH meters need to be calibrated and maintained using methods recommended by manufacturers. • Use appropriate nitrogen source based on plant performance, pH requirement and", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

For example, use of nitrogen in nitrate form at a higher ratio tends to keep the substrate more basic. 1 For more information concerning substrates, see chapter 11. 13. Quality of planting materials 367 • Handle acid and base used for pH control cautiously with appropriate worker protection equipment (safety goggles and gloves). Store them in an appropriately designated acid cabinet. Seeding machine and automation Choose the seeding machine and other automation (tray filler etc.) on the basis of expected use and performance, as it could be a significant capital investment. Types of seed (size, coating and shape), trays (dimension, number of cells) and substrate need to be considered in order to select the best performing machine. IPM facility In order to reduce the risk of introduction into the greenhouse of insect pests or insect-transmitted viruses, it is recommended to: 2 • use a double-door entrance; • cover the air intake (vents) with insect screens; • control weeds inside and outside. IRRIGATION AND FERTIGATION Irrigation It is important to choose an appropriate irrigation method or system, taking account of the relative advantages and disadvantages. There are two basic irrigation systems for transplant production: • Overhead irrigation systems are traditionally used for containerized transplants (Plate 7). However, they can contribute to pathogen attack when used in regions with high temperatures and humidity. • Subirrigation systems (flotation or ebb and flow) are designed to flood beds with nutrient solution. In subirrigation, the water must contain disinfectants and algae growth protectants. The advantages of subirrigation include lower pesticide, water and fertilizer use in propagation, elimination of groundwater contamination, and reduced risk of foliar and soil-borne diseases (Thomas, 1993). Also, overhead watering does not guarantee uniform waterflow throughout the medium and can induce drought stress in the roots, especially during hot seasons. Overhead Plate 7 Overhead irrigation used for transplant production facility 2 For the design or installation criteria and specifications of each facility, refer to chapter 15. To understand the possible impact of insect screens on greenhouse ventilation, refer to chapter 3. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 368 irrigation enhances root growth, but it uses more fertilizer than subirrigation (Nicola and Cantliffe, 1996). To improve fertilizer and water-use efficiency, over-irrigation should be avoided. Transplant quality tends to be low (stem extension or tender tissue) when grown under conditions of over-irrigation. It is important to water transplants thoroughly until the entire substrate is moist, and then allow the substrate water content to reduce before the next watering. When overhead irrigation is used, late afternoon watering should be avoided as the plants remain wet overnight, increasing the likelihood of disease. A too-wet substrate also increases the incidence of damping-off disease. Fertigation Choose the fertilizer concentration, frequency and dose according to plant growth stage and climate conditions (solar radiation and temperature, which influence transpiration demand). For example, target concentrations for fertigation in the solution for tomato seedlings are 80–100 mg/litre total nitrogen (75–100% in nitrate form), 30–50 mg/litre phosphorus, 140–180 mg/litre potassium, 100–150 mg/litre calcium and 30–60 mg/litre magnesium, in addition to other micronutrients. The pH is normally adjusted to 5.5–6.5. Seedlings grown on high rates of nitrogen fertilization are succulent and less resistant to dry weather and solar radiation, leading to a low rate of plant survival after transplanting in the open field (Rosca, 2008). Transplant quality can be improved by applying higher concentrations of fertilizer less frequently (known as “pulse feeding” – Garton et al., 1994), resulting in thicker stem diameters. Limiting fertilizer is also used to harden transplants before shipping or transplanting. Carefully monitor the discharge (amount and EC) to minimize pollution. Direct discharge to the ground should be avoided as it contaminates the groundwater. GROWTH CONTROL AND HARDENING TECHNIQUES Hardening is a crucial step in transplant production. In general, transplants should have well-balanced shoot and root development.

Spindly tender plants are more vulnerable to mechanical damage during handling and transplanting. The quality of transplants affects stand establishment after transplanting to the final production greenhouse. Hardening preconditions transplants to tolerate transplanting stress by exposing them to, for example, water stress; the practice is usually applied to transplants to be used in open-field production or to be grown in environmental conditions harsher than those they were exposed to during propagation. Excessive hardening should be avoided as it may exhaust the plant’s energy reserves (Garton et al., 1994). A typical hardening method involves restriction of the water supply and gradual exposure to conditions expected in the fields or greenhouse to which the plants 13. Quality of planting materials 369 are transplanted (light intensity, day-night temperature oscillation and relative humidity). This hardening process is performed over several days or for over a week, depending on the species and preferred nursery practice. Some vegetable seedlings (e.g. tomato) may also be hardened off with limited fertilization, as too much fertilization, especially nitrogen, tends to make seedlings soft. Some growers move the seedling trays to benches placed in open field in direct sunlight. However, it is recommended that transplants used for greenhouse production be hardened off inside the greenhouse to mitigate the risk of bringing in insect pests. Day-night temperature difference (DIF) Plant stem growth rates of some floricultural and vegetable species are positively correlated to the difference between day temperature (DT) and night temperature (NT), known as DIF (DIF = DT – NT) (Moe and Heins, 1990). A high DIF promotes stem elongation and the daily average temperature determines overall development rate (leaf emergence and flower initiation). Using DIF helps to keep the seedlings compact in size without using growth regulators. Keeping transplants cooler during the day than at night reduces plant height in the temperature range 10–30 °C (Wien, 1997). High temperatures during the first 3–4 hours after sunrise can cause considerable elongation in vegetable seedlings (Bodnar and Garton, 1996). This excessive elongation can be mitigated by keeping the greenhouse temperature cooler (by 4–5 °C) during morning hours than at night (Bodnar and Garton, 1996). Irrigation deficit and water stress When plants are subjected to mild water stress, the rate of stem elongation and leaf area expansion decreases, and carbohydrates accumulate in the leaves. Water stress therefore induces changes in plant growth that are helpful in preparing the plant for transplanting (Wien, 1997). However, as the plant transpiration rate is affected by environmental conditions, experience is required to determine irrigation timing without imposing too much water stress. A soil moisture sensor calibrated for the specific substrate offers an alternative approach. Nutrition deficit The growth rate of transplants can be regulated by controlling the concentration of nitrogen and other nutrients in the substrate. Reducing nutrient supply just before transplanting can slow down the growth rate during the hardening stage. As long as the transplants are not completely starved of the major nutrients by this procedure, there should be little problem with the resumption of growth after transplanting (Wien, 1997). Shaking and brushing Mechanical stress affects seedling growth, because it can enhance ethylene production. Brushing the tops of the transplants several times a day can have remarkable dwarfing effects (i.e. shortening stem and petioles; increasing GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 370 chlorophyll content) (Wien, 1997). The effects of these mechanical perturbations vary among species and cultivars. Brushing has proved successful in solanaceous crops (including tomato, pepper and eggplant), but care should be taken with cucurbits, which are more fragile and may become damaged (Schrader, 2000). With tomato, keeping transplant height short results in a reduction of stem elongation rate, especially important during winter, when light conditions are suboptimal (Fontana et al., 2003). Chemical growth regulators may not be used to control vegetable transplant height (it is necessary to", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

With tomato, keeping transplant height short results in a reduction of stem elongation rate, especially important during winter, when light conditions are suboptimal (Fontana et al., 2003). Chemical growth regulators may not be used to control vegetable transplant height (it is necessary to check the registration status with the local authority). Therefore, mechanical conditioning is one way of controlling stem elongation in commercial greenhouse production. Transplant age When producing vegetable transplants, seedlings should be transplanted at the optimum age. Generally, as the age of the transplant increases, leaf number, height, leaf area and dry shoot weight of vegetable seedlings increase linearly, regardless of transplant cell volume. Avoid any delay in transplanting. Almost all vegetables may be transplanted as early seedlings with little effect on growth, but as they increase in age, this situation changes (Vavrina, 1998). Age strongly influences subsequent performance in the greenhouse. Although planting the largest seedlings possible might appear advantageous in terms of getting the crop off to a quick start, larger seedlings are also more prone to transplanting shock. In general, relatively young vegetable transplants provided with adequate growing space in the greenhouse produce the best stand and fastest crop development. The added stress associated with transplanting larger-than-optimal plants appears to substantially delay crop development. Determine best growing practices for achieving optimum age of transplants. The optimum age depends on the crop, cell size to be used and conditions during the grow-out period. For example, 2-week-old transplants grown in the small cell volume may be the best option for muskmelon growers if their sole concern is total-season yields. However, if growers want to maximize early-season yields, then 2-week-old transplants grown in the large cell volume are the best choice (Walters et al., 2005). Growers must adjust their growing practices and schedules for different crop species and cell sizes. Table 4 lists general guidelines for transplant production in various crops, planting time and cell sizes. There is no single definition of the best seedling age or the most appropriate phenological stage of transplant age. In general, northern countries use older and further developed seedlings, as follows (OMAF, 2007): • Tomatoes: first flowers showing • Cucumbers: 4–5 true leaves visible • Peppers: flower at first branching level opening 13. Quality of planting materials 371 In other countries, tomato seedlings 3–5 weeks old and not yet flowering (Peet and Welles, 2005) are considered ideal, while seedlings over 5 weeks old are less desirable (Zeidan, 2005). While modern cultivars, improved production systems and technical expertise may produce high yields regardless of transplant age, relatively young transplants are still preferred for commercial production under Mediterranean conditions because older seedlings are more costly to produce and difficult to handle. PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDERS Nutrient deficiency and toxicity • Optimize fertilization programme based on the plant’s needs. Different species require different fertilization. Some commercial substrates for transplant production contain a starter charge of fertilizers, in which case no fertilization is required for the first few days. For nitrogen, many plant species perform better when both ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen are used. However, an excessively high rate of ammonium nitrogen may cause toxicity to the plants; furthermore, the form of nitrogen also affects the pH in the substrate (nitrate makes it more basic and ammonium more acidic). An example of phosphorus deficiency in tomato plants is shown in Plate 8.

Bodnar and Garton, 1996 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 372 • Maintain adequate pH in the substrate to avoid nutrient deficiency and toxicity. Generally, a pH of 5.5–6.5 is considered optimum for many plant species: a too high pH can lead to iron deficiency inducing pale green newly emerged leaves; too low can cause micronutrient toxicity (e.g. boron). Some substrates (e.g. peat moss) are acidic and others (e.g. vermiculite) basic. The amount of bicarbonate ions determines the water alkalinity and influences the buffer capacity of the nutrient solution in the substrate. • Use fertilizers from a reliable source to avoid contamination (heavy metals etc.). • Analyse the water quality and design the fertilization programme accordingly. Water quality may change over time (seasons or years), and periodical analysis in a reliable laboratory is therefore recommended. Excessive amounts of sodium, soluble salts or bicarbonates can become problematic and growers may want to consider another water source or different water treatment. Pests and diseases Good agricultural practices relevant to plant propagation are described below. • Inspect planting materials regularly. Early detection is critical to control biological problems and minimize damage. Propagation is usually conducted in short cycles, but because of the high density, pests and diseases spread very rapidly. Once any symptom is found, minimize access to the affected area and notify workers of the outbreak as soon as possible. • Be familiar with the symptoms of commonly occurring pests and diseases to identify problems at an early stage and minimize plant loss. • Apply appropriate control methods (chemical or biological) in consultation with a local extension agent or advisor. • Do not apply foliar fungicides in high temperatures as foliage may get injured. Disorders caused by growing environments Pay attention to light contamination from neighbouring greenhouses and buildings at night. Street lights and worker’s lights sometimes influence plant morphology and flowering. Be familiar with toxicity symptoms of air contaminants. Incomplete combustion of gases causes air pollution that can harm humans as well as plants. The concentrations that negatively affect plants vary according to whether exposure is short term or long term. Young transplants are especially tender and sensitive to by-products of incomplete combustion (Bodnar and Garton, 1996), and tomato is particularly sensitive to ethylene exposure. Problems are often associated with the first use of heating systems in the winter and they disappear as heating demand becomes less. 13. Quality of planting materials 373 TRACEABILITY Record key information for each lot of planting materials (seeds and transplants) including material information (source, type), dates, facility used, environmental data and workers’ names.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 374 ORGANIC TRANSPLANT PRODUCTION Record-keeping Record-keeping and certification are required for all organic producers selling products labelled “certified organic” (Santos, 2007). Production of organic transplants involves more than using organic fertilizers and substrates or avoiding the use of non-approved pesticides. Regulations extend to greenhouse building materials and phytosanitation methods. In an organic nursery, the use of chemical- synthetic products for substrates and plant protection is not allowed; appropriate cultural techniques and inputs must be adopted to obtain well-established seedlings (Nicola et al., 2011). Root zone management is necessary for the main inputs in the organic nursery: containers, substrates and fertilizers (all organic farming certified). Containers and substrates For organic nurseries, biodegradable containers composed of biodegradable polymers are commercially available (Nicola et al., 2010). Organic commercial substrates are composed of peat and other products allowed in organic farming regulations. Peat can be completely substituted using a substrate composed of citrus residues mixed with coconut coir (Possanzini, 2006). New organic substrates that are possible alternatives to peat include: rice hulls or rice chaff (a by-product of rice processing), and Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (an abundant sea plant) (Sambo and Santamaria, 2009). Organic farming regulations list the permitted fertilizers (guano, manure, potash, seaweed etc.) (Nicola et al., 2010); most certified organic fertilizers can be used for post-transplant or mature crop production, since they are generally applied in the soil months before being absorbed by the plant during crop development. The problem of using plant- or animal-based fertilizers is finding horticultural and animal residues originating from organic farming. To improve the uptake of organically based soil nutrition, techniques related to mychorrization could be adopted: through pre-inoculation, the young seedlings benefit from enhanced availability of nutrients, especially those coming from an organic matrix (Conversa et al., 2009). GAPs specific to organic transplant production • Keep records of key information. • Be familiar with materials (trays and substrates) allowed for organic production. 13. Quality of planting materials 375 SEEDLING MYCORRHIZATION Mycorrhization establishes symbiosis between plants and fungi. It can improve not only the growth of seedlings but also their physiological status by enhancing the photosynthetic capacity, and increasing the uptake of water and nutrients and their accumulation in the seedling tissues (Rincón et al., 2005). Environmental conditions characterized by the Mediterranean climate include prolonged dry periods with high temperatures and rain concentrated in a few months. These climatic conditions limit the activity of natural fungal inoculums of soils by reducing the optimal time for fungal spore germination and mycelial growth, thus minimizing the opportunities for root colonization by native fungi. Under these circumstances, controlled nursery inoculation with suitable mycorrhizal fungi can be an advantage for the successful establishment of transplants in Mediterranean regions. Furthermore, water quality in many areas of the region is low due to high salinity: the advantages of mycorrhization include enhancing salinity tolerance (Ruta et al., 2009), enhancing overall plant growth (Conversa et al., 2009), improving product quality (Tiradani and Gianinazzi, 2009; Kappor et al., 2004) and enhancing plant resistance to Fusarium and Phytophthora", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Cultural practices Yuksel Tuzel Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey INTRODUCTION The Mediterranean region is one of the most important areas in the world in terms of protected cultivation, thanks to its mild winter climatic conditions and the possibility of adopting very simple protective shelters. Vegetable production under protected cultivation is a major agricultural sector in most Mediterranean countries and both cultivated area and production have increased consistently in recent decades. Solanaceous crops (tomato, pepper, eggplant) and cucurbits (cucumber, melon, courgettes, watermelon) now account for more than 80 percent of the protected area (Tuzel and Leonardi, 2010). There are a wide range of cultural practices of varying importance, but with the common objective of optimizing production value and maximizing economic returns from vegetable production. Most are associated with integrated pest and disease management, particularly in terms of reduction of pesticide use. Some cultural practices – namely plant protection, irrigation and fertilization – are described in detail in separate chapters. The current chapter focuses on cultural practices related to soil preparation, crop establishment, control of growth and fruit-setting during the cropping period, intercropping, mulching and harvesting. SOIL PREPARATION Although soilless culture is now a well-established technology for intensive greenhouse cultivation, the majority (96.4%) of greenhouse vegetables produced in Mediterranean countries come from soil-grown crops (Tuzel and Leonardi, 2010).

There are a wide range of cultural practices of varying importance, but with the common objective of optimizing production value and maximizing economic returns from vegetable production. Most are associated with integrated pest and disease management, particularly in terms of reduction of pesticide use. Some cultural practices – namely plant protection, irrigation and fertilization – are described in detail in separate chapters. The current chapter focuses on cultural practices related to soil preparation, crop establishment, control of growth and fruit-setting during the cropping period, intercropping, mulching and harvesting. SOIL PREPARATION Although soilless culture is now a well-established technology for intensive greenhouse cultivation, the majority (96.4%) of greenhouse vegetables produced in Mediterranean countries come from soil-grown crops (Tuzel and Leonardi, 2010). Loamy soils are ideal for vegetable production; however most greenhouses are located in coastal areas of the Mediterranean region where sandy textured soils are more common, characterized by high salinity or pH, and a low level of organic matter and nutrients. Advantages are that they warm up earlier, are easier to till, have better drainage and are never too wet. High yields and good quality of high- value greenhouse vegetables can be achieved with correct soil management and attention to the following practices: • Increase of organic matter content to improve soil texture and related characteristics, soil chemical properties and cation exchange capacity. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 380 • Control of salinity and alkalinity. • Provision of adequate and balanced nutrient supply (see chapter 10). • Control of soil-borne pathogens. Increasing organic matter content Nearly 75 percent of the total area in the Mediterranean Basin has low (3.4%) or very low (1.7%) soil organic matter content (Torrento and Oriol, 2002) – a potentially important source of nutrients for plant growth. However, organic matter enrichment is not easy in the Mediterranean region, particularly in greenhouses, owing to the high cost and limited availability of manure, and its rapid mineralization at high temperatures. Application of compost is currently considered to be the most appropriate strategy for compensating annual soil carbon mineralization. However, the supply of 15 tonnes/ha of compost is recommended to reduce the hazards originating from excessive release of nitrates in the soil (Morra et al., 2010). Improvement of salinity From an agricultural point of view, salinity is the concentration of dissolved mineral salts in the soil solution and irrigation waters. Most dissolved mineral salts are in the form of cations and anions. The major cations in saline soil solutions are: Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+, and the major anions: Cl-, SO42-, HCO3- and, at very high pH, also CO32-. Salinity is a major problem in the Mediterranean region due to low water quality; high fertilization; and overexploitation of groundwater, particularly in coastal areas, resulting in intrusion of seawater in terrestrial groundwater courses. Salt accumulation in the root zone depends on water uptake by plants and evaporation from the soil surface; salt concentration is proportional to the volume of water removed by these processes (Bresler et al., 1982). Salt accumulation can be avoided by irrigating with small volumes; tillage; and mulching to prevent upward movement of saline water from deeper layers (FAO, 1990). Control of soil-borne pathogens Soil-borne pathogens can be controlled by soil disinfection: physically, by increasing the soil temperature, or chemically, using fumigants. According to good agricultural practices (GAP), application of chemical treatments for soil disinfection should be avoided as much as possible. With the phasing out of methyl bromide, soil solarization – a non-chemical method to combat soil-borne pathogens – has become an important tool in integrated greenhouse vegetable production and is widely adopted by farmers. Solarization is a process that exploits the greenhouse effect by using transparent plastic materials with the objective of increasing the temperature of the soil for disinfection purposes (Eltez and Tuzel, 1994). The effect of soil solarization can be improved if it is combined with alternative, low toxicity chemicals, biofumigation or the use of grafted seedlings (Tuzel and Özcelik, 2004). 14. Cultural practices 381 PLANTING Greenhouse crop index and occupation index The greenhouse crop index is the number of successive crops per year cultivated in the greenhouse. In recent years, it has decreased as a result of better climate control, particularly ventilation and cooling, enabling a longer growing season (Baudoin, 2006). The greenhouse occupation index represents the number of days per year that the greenhouse is effectively occupied by crops. It has reached 0.85, nearing the currently prevailing index of 0.94 in the Netherlands, as a result of improved greenhouse design, cultivation practices and technology use. However, there remains a significant difference in yield between locations (Table 1).

Solarization – GAP recommendations • Irrigate soil before and during solarization if it becomes dry. • Place transparent PE (25–30 µ) over soil surface and bury edges without gaps (Plate 1). • Leave plastic for 4–6 weeks. • Apply in the summer months (June, July, August) for greatest efficiency. G. OZTEKING Plate 1 Soil solarization GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 382 Cultivation schedule In the Mediterranean region, the growing period is often limited to 7–10 months of the year due to the high temperature and low air humidity which prevail during late spring and summer (Baille, 2001). High greenhouse temperatures, typically occurring from May to August, make year-round cultivation almost impossible. Production is generally seasonal with two peaks: one in spring to early summer and a second in autumn (to the end of December, if the climate is suitable) (Pardossi et al., 2004). The current trend is to lengthen the crop cycle, despite some undesirable consequences on plant performance, quality and harvesting time. While there are advantages in extending the cropping season, it is also necessary to take into account that the harvest times of crops produced in the open air and in greenhouses will overlap more and the products will compete in the same market (La Malfa and Leonardi, 2001). In Mediterranean greenhouses, two or more crops per year are already grown as either long or short cycle (Table 1). Production season and length of crop cycle depend on the species, local climatic conditions (i.e. temperature and light), availability of climate control (i.e. heating/cooling) in the greenhouse, market demand and export potential. Good planning of the production season increases the economic return for farmers, particularly if based on market analysis – for example, growers in the Jordan Valley start ‘Charentais’ melon production in November on the basis of good prospects for export to Europe. Planting density Plant density indicates the number of plants per unit of cultivated area and is directly linked to final yield and product quality. Plant density (plant spacing) affects light interception by the canopy and its efficiency of use by the crops. Increased plant density results in increased biomass production due to enlargement of the total crop leaf area, while single plant fresh weight and fruit size are restricted (Yang et al., 2009). Optimal plant density depends on species, length of growing cycle, seasonal changes in the light, climate, and training and pruning of the crop; other considerations are greenhouse design and climate control (particularly ventilation rate). High plant density improves light interception, but if the ventilation rate Plate 2 High plant density in high tunnels causes severe disease problems Y. TUZEL 14.

Excessively high density can lead to incidence of disease; plant density should be lower in long-cycle crops than in short-cycle crops. Table 2 shows the average plant density recommended for some important greenhouse vegetables. Row orientation Light interception is affected by both row orientation and plant density, which in turn depend on greenhouse location and the cultivation seasons. Li et al. (2000) reported that the normalized daily canopy irradiance with E–W orientation (compared with N–S orientation) was higher in winter at 35°N and lower in spring and summer. However, at 45o and 55°N, N–S orientation gave higher values than E–W, regardless of season. TRAINING AND PRUNING Training Crops with indeterminate growth (e.g. tomato, cucumber, pepper) need to be trained in order to control the number and the position of apical meristems per plant which govern plant growth and development. In practice, controlling the number of apical meristems means controlling the number of shoot apices; this is achieved either by completely removing new shoots or by cutting off shoot tips. Training aims to increase light penetration throughout the leaf canopy (thereby increasing light interception by photosynthetically active leaves), increase TABLE 2 Plant density of vegetables (plant/m2) grown in different cycles Long cycle Autumn Spring No. stems Tomato 2.5 3–3.5 3–3.5 Single Pepper 2–2.5 2.5–3.5 3–4 shoots Cucumber 2.7 3.3 3.3 Single Eggplant 1.5–2.2 2.5 2–3 shoots Melon 2.5 Single Zucchini 1.5 1.5 Single Plate 3 Plants in front of windows prevent airflow Y.

TUZEL GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 384 airflow, and reduce the incidence and spread of diseases. The training system adopted depends on the crop species, length of growing cycle and greenhouse design: • Plants are supported using string (plastic or polypropylene twine). • The string is attached to a cable stretched above the plant row (Plate 5). • Plants are wrapped around the string or attached to it with plastic clips (Plate 6). • In long-term, layered tomato crops, there are many different ways to attach the strings and their plants to the cables: the slip knot (by hand), metal string bobbins or a notched spool with a hook (Plate 7) (Hochmuth, 2008a). Pruning Pruning in greenhouse crops includes the complete removal of new side shoots, the removal of shoot apices and leaves, as well as fruit thinning. Most greenhouse vegetables need pruning; the pruning of shoots is essential for plant training, and there are other benefits: Plate 6 Plastic clips and supports for trusses G.

Cultural practices 385 • Reduction of competition between shoots within a plant for light, nutrients and water by removing unnecessary plant parts, thus increasing assimilates to each remaining shoot. • Increase of light penetration through the leaf canopy for more efficient light interception. • Reduction of occurrence of pests and diseases by increasing airflow among the leaves and preventing local spots of excessive humidity within the canopy. • Improvement of fruit quality, because the reduction in the number of shoots results in more assimilates being allocated to each fruit, and the final fruit product is therefore bigger. Pruning may be modified to adapt to the growing season, the length of the growth cycle and the variety, but it should always be done on time and properly. Pruning is also an opportunity to inspect plants for problems with pests, diseases or nutritional disorders. In order to prevent new infection or the spread of pests and diseases, equipment should be disinfected and all waste material from pruning should be removed from the greenhouse (Plates 9 and 10).

TUZEL FIGURE 1 Side shoot removal www.westcarlston.com/info_tomato_growing.htm G. OZKETIN GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 386 In some circumstances, two stems per plant can be allowed to develop in order to save money. In this case the apex of the main stem is pinched off at an early growth stage and two lateral shoots are allowed to develop on opposite sides of the rows. This practice is more frequent in grafted plants (which are more expensive), in order to reduce the cost of purchasing seedlings. It reduces the number of plants per unit area by 50 percent. Each stem is tied and grown like a single plant (Plate 11). In northern Europe, with long-season tomato crops, it is quite common to allow one side shoot to grow out after the main shoot has been growing for a few weeks so that each root system supports two (or even four) shoots. This practice increases plant density and thus the number of fruits available; it is a strategy for coping with the increase in assimilates produced as the daily light integral increases and for producing fruit of one uniform size (Cockshull and Ho, 1995; Cockshull et al., 2001). The growing season and climatic conditions should be taken into consideration when deciding the number of stems per plant. Most of the assimilates supplied to the fruit of each truss (cluster) come from the two or three leaves under that truss. If leaves are removed too early, the growth and final size of the fruit are adversely affected, but removal of the leaves under the fruit truss once fruit is at the mature green stage will speed up the ripening process, improve air circulation and reduce disease incidence (e.g. botrytis). It is true that old leaves, even before they start yellowing, need to be removed because they have limited access to light and thus lose more carbon through respiration than they gain carbon by photosynthesis. Their presence negatively affects crop performance Leaf pruning is also related to layering or “leaning and lowering”. Truss thinning is performed to obtain the fruit size required by the market (Plate 12). Pepper The plant starts as a single stem, trained into two or more stems as soon as the first vigorous lateral stems appear. Pepper plants can be trellised according to the “Spanish” system or the “Dutch” (“V”) system: • Spanish trellis system. The plant canopy is allowed to grow without pruning. Plate 11 Double stem tomato plants at different growing stages G. OZKETIN Plate 12 Truss thinning M. QARYOUTI 14. Cultural practices 387 The plants are vertically supported by a structure of poles and horizontal twines extended on both sides of the plant rows (Plate 13). Labour requirements are thus reduced by at least 75 percent compared with the “V” trellis system (Jovicich et al., 2003 and 2004) . • V system. The plant generally has two or three main stems (Plate 14). All lateral shoots are removed up to the branching point and the shoots are then pruned to form a plant with several branches. The first flower (crown flower) is removed to promote vegetative growth. Only the flower on the nodes adjacent to the leaf is left on each branch (Figure 2). Cucumber Fruits and lateral shoots are removed up to a height of 30 cm to encourage vigorous early vegetative growth, essential for maximum fruit production.

TUZEL FIGURE 2 Pepper pruning Nederhoff, 2002 Y. TUZEL Plate 14 Pepper pruning Y. TUZEL GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 388 density. However, an excessively high stem density can negatively affect mean fruit size (and thus marketable yield and fruit quality), even though the total yield may still increase. Strong lateral branches are allowed to grow following formation of the first flower, while all lateral shoots below that height are removed. At each node, in addition to one main flower, one or more secondary flowers may develop. Although most secondary flowers do not set fruit, some of them may develop into a small fruit, depending on plant vigour. However, in most cases these fruits are undersized and thus non-marketable; fruit-setting on the secondary flowers is, therefore, a waste of assimilates. Despite this, the removal of secondary flowers is not usually recommended as standard pruning treatment, since the labour required exceeds the expected benefits from the small saving in assimilates. Old leaves should be removed to allow air circulation and light interception (Plate 15). FRUIT-SETTING The yield of most fruit-bearing greenhouse vegetables depends on the success of fruit-set which is linked to pollination; only parthenocarpic cultivars (e.g. cucumber) do not need pollination. Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains to the stigma: they are released from the anthers and usually fall onto the stigma. In greenhouses, in contrast to open field production, pollination needs assistance due to the limited air movement and high humidity. Pollination can be assisted by mechanical vibration or by bumblebees. However, pollen viability and the amount of pollen – both of which are particularly dependent on temperature – are also important for successful pollination. Mechanical vibration Vibrators (usually battery powered) are used on tomato by holding them against the stem of each truss for a few seconds (Plate 16). The operation should be carried out at least three times a week between 10.00 and 15.00 hours (humidity low, high pollen availability) (Hochmuth, 2008a). Mechanical vibration is a good agricultural practice, but it is time-consuming. Plate 15 Eggplant pruning Y. TUZEL 14. Cultural practices 389 Bumblebees Bee species used as pollinators include honey bees (Osmia cornuta) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Bumblebees are the most efficient and are used in greenhouses worldwide. The advantages of bumblebees in comparison to honey bees can be summarized as follows: • Faster, visiting 8–20 flowers per minute • More efficient, visiting 400 flowers in one trip • Better contact because of large size • Better worker, because of the lack of communication system Bumblebees are placed in the greenhouse inside the hives and remain active for about 6–8 weeks (Plate 17). The use of bumblebees for pollination has numerous advantages: • Increased crop yield • Higher fruit quality • Reduction in labour costs • Safer product • Decrease in risk of fungal disease after use of plant growth regulators (PGR) • Low pesticide input and use of low-toxicity pesticides – essential to avoid harming the bumblebees Research with tomato has shown that the use of bumblebees for pollination is more effective than mechanical vibration or plant growth regulators (PGR) given the improvement in fruit number and mean fruit weight (Tables 3 and 4).

TUZEL 14. Cultural practices 391 Plant growth regulators Plant growth regulators (PGR) have been used for years in agriculture for various purposes. In greenhouse vegetable crops they can be used for parthenocarpic fruit- setting, particularly under temperature conditions that are too low or too high for standard pollination (Table 6, Plate 19). However, chemicals used as PGRs can negatively affect fruit quality (i.e. shape, size, colour, seed development), especially when doses exceed standard recommendations (Plate 20). The most common PGRs used for fruit-set in greenhouses are β-NOA (β-naphthoxyacetic acid) and 4-CPA (4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid). Commercial use of PGRs is subject to legislative restrictions (e.g. 91/414/EEC for the European Union). Maximum residue levels (MRLs) (EC regulation 396/2005) are available at http://ec.europa.eu/sanco_ pesticides/public/index.cfm. INTERCROPPING Intercropping is the cultivation of two or more crops together in the same area. Each crop should have sufficient space, but in order to maximize cooperation and minimize competition between crops, spatial distribution (row, strip, mixed, relay intercropping), plant density, harvesting periods and plant architecture need to be considered (Sullivan, 2003). Good management of the planting schedule, fertilization, plant protection and harvesting period is necessary to increase intercropping performance. Intercropping performance can be assessed using the land equivalency ratio (LER), which shows the yield advantage of the intercrop over a single crop. It is the sum of the division of intercrop yields to the pure crop yields for each crop in the intercrop. It can be calculated using the equation of LER=S(Yint/Ypure), where Yint is the yield of each crop in intercropping and Ypure is the pure yield of each crop (Vandermeer, 1992; Sullivan, 2003).

Although intercropping has some advantages (e.g. reduced risk of total crop failure), it is not widely practised in greenhouses where the monocultural production of high-value crops is more usual. However, intercropping may be used, particularly relay intercropping, i.e. the cultivation of more than one crop simultaneously during the growing cycle. For example, leafy vegetables (e.g. lettuce, green onion) and some herbs (e.g. basil) could be intercropped with high-value vegetables (e.g. tomato) (Jett et al., 2005). Intercropping can be more profitable for small-scale greenhouses because of product diversification. Mulching Mulching is the covering of the soil surface with any material which separates the soil from the atmosphere. Mulching material can be either organic (e.g. crop residues such as straw) or inorganic (e.g. plastic film). It can be grown in situ (e.g. residues of a previous crop left on the soil surface, a cover crop grown among the rows and its residues left, or a living mulch grown as a cover crop). Alternatively, it can be grown or produced ex situ (e.g. straw, sawdust and plastic products). Mulching has a buffering effect which depends on the quality, quantity and durability of the material, soil type and climatic conditions (Acharya et al., 2005). To maximize the advantages of mulching, application must be appropriate to the soil, crop and climatic conditions of a site. The most common mulch materials are plastic films (Figure 5), but their intensive use causes environmental problems as a result of their high chemical FIGURE 5 Reflection, absorption and transmission of three mulching films 14. Cultural practices 393 stability. Since the plastic materials used for mulching require a long time to complete their decomposition, research focuses mainly on the production of biodegradable polymers (Plate 21) which could reduce the environmental pollution resulting from the disposal of plastic films (Bilck et al., 2010). HARVESTING Greenhouse vegetables are harvested once at commercial maturity, which depends on the species, market demand and destination (local or export). Tomato may be picked as individual fruit (sometimes without the green calyx, especially if intended for export), or the stem of the whole truss can be cut with scissors and marketed as “tomatoes on the vine” or “truss tomatoes” (“cluster tomatoes”). Fruits should be handled carefully to avoid damage, especially bruising. For each crop species there are distinct standards for classification (size, weight) and quality (well-developed or damaged), in addition to specific provisions concerning presentation and marking etc. (www.unece.org). There are also maximum residue levels (MRL) for each product to ensure food safety. Given the increasing consumer awareness and public concern about the impact of harmful chemical residues on human health, greenhouse products should be free of chemical (e.g. pesticide) and microbiological contamination.

GAP recommendations • Plan the production season based on market analysis. • Pay attention to soil management for high yield, high quality and high value: - Perform as little tillage as possible. - Maintain or restore soil organic content by manure or compost application. - Analyse soil and organic manure (or compost) to prevent contamination; apply adequate and balanced nutrients at appropriate times and in appropriate doses. - Control salinity by irrigating with small volumes, by tillage and by mulching to prevent upward movement of saline water from the deeper layers. - Control soil-borne pathogens by avoiding the application of chemical treatments for soil disinfection whenever possible. • Adopt soil solarization – a non-chemical method to combat soil-borne pathogens: - Apply in the summer months (June, July, August). - Irrigate soil before and during solarization if it becomes dry. - Place transparent PE (25–30 µm) over the soil surface; bury the edges without gaps. - Leave plastic in place for 4–6 weeks. • Use correct plant spacing: - Avoid too high density to prevent disease incidence. - Keep density lower in long-cycle crops than in short-cycle crops. • Adopt timely and correct pruning techniques; remove all waste material to prevent new infection or the spread of pest and diseases. • Use bumblebees for pollination: - Place hives 0.5–1 m above the ground. - Protect hives against sun and condensation of water. - Avoid ants or other insects entering hives. • Adopt site-appropriate mulching for efficient management at different sites, with different soils, crops and climatic conditions. • Handle harvested fruit carefully to avoid damage, especially bruising. For each crop, take account of distinct quality standards for the classification (size, colour), tolerances, definitions (i.e. well-developed or damaged) and classification of defects.

Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation Marwan Abdel Wali National Center for Agricultural Research and Extension, Amman, Jordan INTRODUCTION Integrated pest management (IPM) offers a practical method for the effective management of pests under greenhouses. Through the adoption of sound cultural practices and monitoring techniques, accurate problem identification, and timely implementation and evaluation of appropriate management strategies, growers can improve vegetable production while minimizing their reliance on routine pesticide applications. IPM makes use of many different management options: cultural, physical, mechanical, biological and chemical. Routine crop inspection alerts growers to developing pest and cultural problems while they are still minor and easily manageable. Early detection and intervention is the foundation of an IPM programme. Greenhouse management for the control of insects and diseases depends on: the local climate; external disease and insect pressure; the greenhouse structural design; availability of climate control equipment; and the skill level of the greenhouse workers.

INSECT PEST EXCLUSION TECHNIQUES Sanitation It is important to keep the area around the exterior and interior of the greenhouse free from weeds and other plants that could harbour pests. An inventory should be made of plants in the area around the greenhouse to determine their relative risk as a pest harbour: remove high risk plants, with the exception of those that could attract natural enemies and pollinators. Airlock entrance Walk-in doorways provide an easy entrance for many pests; growers need to evaluate strategies to reduce the likelihood of pest entrance. In greenhouses with fan and pad ventilation, an airlock entrance room is essential: attached to the GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 400 exterior of the greenhouse and enclosing the entry doorway, its double-door system allows workers to enter the airlock room and close the outside door behind them before entering the greenhouse production area. Without the airlock room, the fans pull air in through the unprotected doorway rather than through the screened opening at the opposite end of the greenhouse, and it is common to see pest infestations beginning in plants close to an unprotected doorway. Even in passively ventilated greenhouses, a secure entrance room is important to regulate the easy entrance of pests to the production area. Such rooms can also be used as a footbath and hand-washing area, and for any other sanitation practices for workers. Insect screening Screens with a fine mesh to keep insects out of the greenhouse can be an important element in an IPM programme and may be used effectively in both passively ventilated and fan and pad greenhouses. Any screens added to a ventilation opening will reduce airflow through that opening. It is therefore important to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations to increase the surface area covered by the screen to compensate for the reduction in airflow, which in turn can burn fan motors or reduce cooling by reducing ventilation. Reflective or metallized mulches Highly reflective or metallized plastic mulches have been used in agriculture for many purposes and are particularly effective in reducing the entry of whitefly and thrips. Combining screening and metallized mulch results in the greatest total reduction of whitefly entry. Scouting and insect monitoring Even with implementation of all the above exclusion techniques, some insects will still enter the greenhouse. Early detection of pests in the crop is crucial and pest monitoring tools and techniques must be used, for example, yellow sticky traps, plant scouting and examination of plants with a hand lens. Pest infestations are usually location-specific; for example, hot spots of pests near ventilation or doorway openings are common. Control strategies If pest populations build to a threshold level requiring control measures, growers must be prepared for the immediate implementation of a control plan taking account of the current specific spray or biological control recommendations: • Choose either an IPM or traditional pesticide strategy. Many excellent biological control agents are now available against common pests; however, in the case of virus transmission from insect vectors (whitefly transmitting yellow leaf curl virus), be cautious with biological control strategies because a low level of a pest population is necessary to “feed” the beneficial agent. 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 401 • Carefully examine pesticide choices and use the safest effective materials available. • Follow a good pesticide rotation programme to slow the development of pesticide resistance. Many “soft” or “biorational” pesticides (e.g. soaps, oils, neem products and Bacillus thuringiensis [Bt]) can play an important role in an IPM programme for greenhouse vegetables. SOIL PREPARATION Soil should be slightly acid (around pH 6.5). If in doubt, soil analysis is required through the local extension office, by a private lab, or with a commercial soil test kit. Lime can be used to increase soil pH, and sulphur to lower pH. Adequate levels of soil fertility need maintaining through addition of potassium- and phosphorus-releasing materials, such as commercial fertilizers or animal manures.

Soil testing should be done every three years to determine the levels of these important nutrients. The regular addition of organic matter, such as yard waste, compost and manure, is important for a biologically active, healthy soil. PLANT SELECTION • Select vegetable varieties with maximum insect and disease resistance. • Buy plants from a reputable nursery which can guarantee that they are free from disease and insects with a phytosanitary control certificate; alternatively, grow your own from seed of which the health status has been checked. • Space plants properly and thin young vegetables to a proper stand. Overcrowding causes weak growth and reduces air movement, resulting in increased insect and disease problems. • Keep down weeds and grass. They often harbour pests and compete for nutrients and water. Leaf and other organic mulches are extremely effective for weed control, as are inorganic weed mats, plastic and other fabrics. • Avoid injury to plants – broken limbs, cuts, bruises, cracks and insect damage are often the site for infection by disease-causing organisms. • Remove and dispose of infected leaves from diseased plants as soon as they are observed; likewise, remove severely diseased plants before they contaminate others. The infected plants and leaves can be used to make compost. • Clean up crop refuse at the end of each day’s work. DISEASE MANAGEMENT Vegetable diseases include early blight, late blight, powdery mildew, downy mildew, damping-off, and viral and bacterial diseases. For effective control, they must be properly identified. An integrated approach to disease management involves the use of resistant cultivars, sanitation, sound cultural practices and the proper use of the correct pesticides. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 402 RESISTANT CULTIVARS The number of pest-resistant cultivars in various greenhouse crops has greatly increased in recent years. In some cases, using a resistant cultivar is the most successful method in an IPM strategy. One of the challenges in greenhouse vegetable crop production is the need for multiple resistance and growers should carefully research information on new resistant cultivars with the potential to fit production and market demands. A cultivar must not only solve a specific pest problem, but must also be acceptable to consumers. It is advisable to evaluate new cultivars in a small portion of the crop area before switching entirely to an untested cultivar. GROWING MEDIA Soilless media are generally purchased in bags or custom mixed on site and contain no field soil. Preventive applications of one or several fungicides or biological fungicides may be necessary with some crops that are prone to damping-off. Field soil, whether used by itself or as an amendment in a soilless medium, must be treated to eliminate soil-borne plant pathogens, insects and weed seeds. Once the soil has been treated, care must be taken to avoid reinfestation. TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE HIGH HUMIDITY High relative humidity is one of the major contributing factors to Botrytis blight (a common fungal disease of plants under greenhouses) and other serious diseases. Warm air has the capacity to hold more moisture than cool air; therefore, on warm days, greenhouse air is more humid. As the air cools in the evening, the moisture-holding capacity drops until the dew point is reached; water then begins to condense on surfaces. One recommended practice is to heat and vent two or three times per hour in the evening after the sun goes down and early in the morning at sunrise. Horizontal airflow (HAF) can also reduce condensation. HAF fans keep the air moving in the greenhouse, helping to minimize temperature differentials and cold spots where condensation occurs. Air that is moving is continually mixed; the mixed air along the surface does not cool below the dew point so does not condense on plant surfaces. Humidity within the plant canopy can also be reduced by adopting appropriate cultural practices, including proper watering practices and spacing of plants. However, since most vegetable plants are grown in flats that are spaced flat to flat, reducing humidity in the canopy is not easy.

Proper planting dates, plant nutrition, watering practices and height management are all effective techniques to help prevent lush, overgrown plants, thereby reducing humidity within the canopy. 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 403 FUNGICIDES Fungicides are potentially very effective with some diseases, but may be ineffective with others (Table 1): • Root diseases: apply broad-spectrum fungicides as a drench on a preventive basis, read directions on the pesticide labels, and note that an additional application of water may be necessary. • Foliage diseases: obtain thorough spray coverage, and treat when disease is first evident. BIOFUNGICIDES Biofungicides are biological fungicides that contain living organisms (fungi or bacteria) which attack plant pathogens and thus help to fight the diseases they cause. They can be used as part of an integrated disease management programme to reduce the risk of pathogens developing resistance to traditional fungicides. Currently, there are no pathogens resistant to biological fungicides. Furthermore, they have a lower re-entry interval (REI) than traditional fungicides and many can be used in rotation with other chemicals. Biological fungicides can suppress diseases in a variety of ways: • Compete directly with the pathogen. • Shield the roots by growing a defensive barrier around them. • Produce an antibiotic or another toxin that kills the target organism. • Attack and feed upon the pathogen (in this case, the biological fungicide must already be present when the pathogen appears or before). • Induce the plant to turn on its own defence mechanisms. Biofungicides provide preventive treatment and should be used as part of a regular monitoring programme where root health and crop quality is evaluated. They do not cure diseased plants and must be applied before the onset of the disease, used in conjunction with standard cultural practices for disease prevention. Storage conditions, soil and air temperatures, and the use of other chemicals all affect their efficacy. Most biological fungicides have a limited shelf-life of one year. A number of products are commercially available for use on vegetables (Table 1). SPECIFIC DISEASES Late blight (Phytophthora infestans) Late blight disease has worldwide distribution; it attacks tomato and causes extensive damage, especially in the temperate zone. It is a polycyclic disease, i.e. many cycles of infection are possible in one growing season. Disease increases when relative humidity is 90–100 percent. It occurs in a wide range of temperatures from 3 to 26 °C, but the optimum temperature range is 18–22 °C.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 406 Symptoms Random brown spots appear in the plants above ground level. The spots are water-soaked and may rapidly grow into pale green to brown lesions, covering a wide area, including stems, leaves and fruits. The small infected fruit are dark brown and appear burnt as if damaged by fire; early in the morning a very soft white mould appears on the fruit surface. This disease spreads rapidly and in a few days can completely destroy a crop, especially in greenhouse-grown tomato. Late blight only affects pepper plants at the cotyledon stage as plants emerge from the soil medium in the greenhouses. Management • Control weeds. • Remove plant debris between crop cycles and during production. • Dispose of diseased plants and debris in plastic bags; keep bags closed to prevent the spread of spores to uninfected plants during removal from the greenhouse. • Reduce humidity and leaf wetness duration to prevent spore germination, provide good air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy. • Pay attention to proper planting dates, soil fertility, watering and vegetative development to prevent plants from becoming overgrown, with the aim of reducing humidity within the canopy. Early blight (Alternaria solani) Early blight disease of tomato and other solanaceous crops has worldwide distribution and is a major concern to growers. It is polycyclic, and when transplants are affected (known as “collar rot” in seedlings), losses can reach 40 percent. Favourable environmental conditions for early blight occurrence are warmth and humidity. Spores germinate and infect plants in a broad range of temperatures (5–40 °C), but the optimal range is 20–28 °C. Increased leaf maturity, heavy fruit load, crowded plants, heavy rainfall, dew and shading all enhance disease development. Symptoms Symptoms appear on leaves and stems, initially on the older leaves as small, dark necrotic spots that develop into lesions. The spots and lesions then spread upwards in the plant foliage as the disease progresses; young leaves are relatively resistant. The lesions have the distinctive shape of a target board with concentric rings. As the necrotic lesions expand on the leaves, the leaves become blighted and subsequently defoliated. 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 407 Management There are no commercial tomato cultivars with a sufficient level of resistance to early blight and appropriate cultural practices must be adopted to manage the disease: • Crop rotation, sanitation and maintenance of host vigour. • Reduction of humidity and leaf wetness duration to prevent spore germination, provide good air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy. • Attention to proper planting dates, fertility, watering and height management to prevent plants from becoming overgrown, with the aim of reducing humidity within the canopy.

Botrytis blight (Botrytis cinerea) Botrytis can cause leaf blight, cankers, damping-off and root rot. Plants may be attacked at any stage, but new tender growth, freshly injured tissues and dead tissues are most susceptible. Symptoms Botrytis blight produces characteristic grey fuzzy spores on the surface of infected tissues. Air currents and splashing water can easily disseminate the spores. In general, germination of spores and infection are dependent on a film of moisture lasting 8–12 hours, relative humidity of at least 90 percent and temperatures between 13 and 18 °C. After infection, colonization of plant tissues can occur at temperatures of up to 21 °C. Management Management of environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity and duration of leaf wetness, together with sound cultural practices and use of fungicides, will help prevent disease development: • Control weeds. • Remove plant debris between crop cycles and during production. • Dispose of diseased plants and debris in plastic bags; keep bags closed to prevent the spread of spores to uninfected plants as the bag is removed from the greenhouse. • Reduce humidity and leaf wetness duration to prevent spore germination, provide good air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy. • Pay attention to proper planting dates, fertility, watering and height management to prevent plants from becoming overgrown, with the aim of reducing humidity within the canopy. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 408 Powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica) Powdery mildew may occasionally occur in vegetable transplants, including tomato, eggplant and other solanaceous crops, as well as cucurbit crops. Powdery mildew, unlike many foliar diseases, does not need free moisture on the leaf to thrive. Favourable environmental conditions include high relative humidity (> 95%), moderate temperatures of between 20 and 30 °C and relatively low light levels. Infections may be more common in spring when day and night temperature difference encourages high relative humidity levels, especially at night. Air currents and water splashing in the greenhouse easily move these spores. Once a spore lands on a plant, it may take as little as 3 days (but more often 5–7 days) for infection to develop. Symptoms Powdery mildew is easily recognized by its white talcum-like growth. Faint, white mycelium may develop on leaves and stems, with yellow margins. When symptoms develop on the more mature leaves, powdery mildew is harder to detect and seems to occur “overnight”, catching many growers unaware. As soon as environmental conditions are favourable, powdery mildew develops into an epidemic as more leaves become infected. Management • Maintain proper plant spacing to reduce relative humidity levels within the plant canopy and improve spray coverage. • Keep relative humidity levels below 90 percent in the greenhouse. Heat and ventilate in the late afternoon and early morning to reduce high relative humidity at night. • Clean the greenhouse thoroughly between crops, removing all weeds that could be potential hosts. Downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubenisis) This disease is the most important foliar disease of cucurbits: infected plants produce very little marketable fruit and may die; loss of leaves also exposes the fruit to sunscald. Disease development requires 6 hours of 100 percent relative humidity at the leaf surface in a broad range of temperatures from 5 to 30 °C (optimal range 15–20 °C). Symptoms Symptoms occur only on leaves; they begin as small, yellow spots, often angular, on the upper surface of the leaves. On the underside of the leaf, these spots appear as a grey-black mildew. Lesions appear first on older leaves and spread to newer growth, followed by general yellowing. Eventually, progressively larger areas die and turn light brown. 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 409 Management Disease development may be prevented by: • management of environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity and duration of leaf wetness); • adoption of sound cultural practices; and • use of fungicides.

Damping-off of seedlings (Rhizoctonia sp., Fusarium sp., Phytophthora sp., Pythium sp.) Damping-off is a common disease in germinating seeds and young seedlings. Several fungi are capable of causing damping-off, including Rhizoctonia, Alternaria, Sclerotinia and the water moulds, Phytophthora and Pythium. Soil- borne fungi do not usually produce air-borne spores, but are easily transported from contaminated soil to pathogen-free soil by infected tools, hose ends, water splash and hands. Young seedlings are most susceptible to damping-off; however, later in the crop cycle, the same pathogens may cause root and stem rot. Symptoms Symptoms include seedlings failing to emerge or wilting, often with a stem lesion that appears water-soaked or dark, necrotic and sunken at the soil line. The disease usually spreads radically from a central point of origin; therefore, plants often die in a circular pattern. Vegetable seeds germinated in poorly drained, cool soils are especially susceptible, and young plants that do emerge are weak and often wilt at or below the soil line. Tomato and pepper seedlings may be girdled by brown or black sunken cankers; stems of these plants may shrivel and become dark and woody. While plants do not necessarily collapse, they remain stunted and die after transplanting. Management Prevention is the only effective approach, because damping-off is difficult to stop once symptoms occur. There are several strategies to prevent damping-off: • Use only certified disease-free seed from reputable seed companies. • Use fungicide-treated seed: certain fungicides are labelled for damping-off for selected vegetable crops. • Use pasteurized soil, compost-based or soilless mixes. • Avoid overwatering, excessive fertilizer, overcrowding, poor air circulation, careless handling and planting too deeply. • Provide adequate light for rapid growth. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 410 White mould (Sclerotina sclerotiorum) Most common in the greenhouse during winter and spring, white mould infects leaves, stems and fruits. The infected spot of mould resembles white cotton and covers the infected parts of the plants, including stems, leaves and fruits. Inside the discoloured stems, the fungus produces hard, black sclerotia. Management • Practise strict sanitation, removing debris from the greenhouse to prevent renewed infection. • Control the quantities and the duration of irrigation to reduce soil wetness. • Adopt sound cultural practices and fungicides to help prevent disease development. BACTERIAL DISEASES Bacterial leaf spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria) Bacterial leaf spot is caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and survives on spontaneous tomato, plant debris, soil and seeds. It is spread by heavy rainfall, wind and seeds. Disease development is favoured by warm temperatures (24–30 °C) and high relative humidity. The symptoms are water-soaked circular brown spots during rainy periods. On green fruits, lesions become slightly raised and surrounded by greenish white halos that eventually turn irregular and brown, with a sunken scabby surface. While it occurs primarily on peppers, all above-ground parts of tomatoes are also susceptible. The spots on the leaves are chocolate brown and irregularly shaped with areas of dead leaf tissue; initially they are less than 0.6 cm in diameter. Severely spotted leaves appear scorched and defoliation may occur. It is most prevalent during moderately high temperatures and long periods of leaf wetness. Bacterial speck (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato) Bacterial speck, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, occurs on tomato but not on pepper. The bacterium is seed-borne and can survive in crop residue for up to 30 weeks. It spreads with heavy rainfall, by mechanical means and through seeds, especially under conditions of high humidity and low temperature (18–24 °C). The symptoms are numerous small dark brown to black lesions with a yellow margin on the leaves. On the fruits, minute lesions develop that are dark and over 1 mm in diameter. Bacterial speck is usually distinguished from bacterial spot by the size of the lesions; however, the symptoms are sometimes similar. Bacterial canker (Clavibacter michiganensis) Bacterial canker in tomato is caused by Clavibacter michiganensis. The bacterium is seed-borne but can survive on plant debris in the soil for one year; it can also 15.

The bacterium is seed-borne but can survive on plant debris in the soil for one year; it can also 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 411 survive in the greenhouse on wooden stakes and flats. Wilt, leaf scorch, canker, pith necrosis and fruit spot may occur singly or in combination, depending on the circumstances. When the bacterium is carried in the seed, the vascular system becomes colonized, resulting in wilt, pith necrosis and external cankers. Wilt initially occurs on one side of a leaf or one half of a plant because only a portion of the vascular system is blocked. Cankers and pith necrosis occur in later stages of disease development. Cankers are dark and water-soaked in appearance and often exude bacteria that are easily spread to adjacent plants. When leaf scorch occurs, the petioles usually bend downwards, while the leaf edges curl up. The margins of the leaves become brown with a yellow border on the inside. Scorching of the foliage often develops in the absence of wilt or stem canker. Transplants may not express symptoms until 6–8 weeks after infection and initial symptom expression is accelerated by environmental stress. Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum can survive in weeds and seeds, and in soil for 2–10 years. It is disseminated by running water, soil movement or movement of infected transplants. Disease development is favoured by high temperatures (30–35 °C) and high relative humidity. The symptoms are dark brown vascular systems in the stem of infected plants; the pith and cortex become dark brown and the infected plant wilts completely. Bacterial soft rot (Erwinia carotovora sp. carotovora) The bacterium Erwinia carotovora sp. carotovora survives in soil, plant debris and weeds. It is spread by surface irrigation of soil, by wind and seeds, and through cultural practices. Disease development is favoured by warm temperatures (25– 30 °C) and high relative humidity. The disease causes the plant to wilt rapidly; the pith usually disintegrates, becoming wet and slimy and leaving a hollow stem. Whole fruit may become a soft, watery, colourless, decayed mass in 3–5 days. Infected plant parts produce a foul odour that is very characteristic. Angular leaf spot (Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans) Angular leaf spot on cucumber is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans. It is seed-borne and survives beneath the seed-coat, and upon germination the cotyledons become infected. It can also survive in crop residues for 10 months, and in the soil for about 140 days at 5–15 °C. It is spread by rainfall and insects, and through cultural practices. Disease development is favoured by warm temperatures (24–27 °C) and high relative humidity. Symptoms are water-soaked spots on the leaves, becoming yellow necrotic spots confined by veins giving them an angular appearance. The necrotic centre may drop out. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 412 Management of bacterial diseases Bacteria can be introduced via infected seeds, infected transplants purchased from another operation, or directly in the field via crop residues; they can also survive on weeds in the same family as the host crop. A similar management approach can be adopted for all the above bacterial diseases. VIRAL DISEASES Viral diseases may infect hundreds of plant species including tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and cucumber. Most viruses are spread by insect vectors, such as whitefly, aphid and thrips; others are seed-borne and mechanically transmitted (Table 2). Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) Typical mosaic marks appear on the foliage and yield is significantly reduced. The most common symptoms are light and dark green mottling and dark brown discoloration on tomatoes, making them unfit for consumption. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) • Tomato. The leaves are affected more than the fruit; plants are often stunted, have short internodes, and may have extremely distorted and malformed leaves, known as fern leaf.

A number of copper products are registered for bacterial disease control. 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 413 • Cucumber. Fruit and leaves are both affected, as the leaves become mottled, distorted and wrinkled, and their edges begin to curl downwards; the internal part of the fruit turns brown, making it unfit for consumption or processing. • Pepper. Severe mosaic forms on the foliage; older leaves may have large necrotic rings, fruit may be malformed, and conspicuous yellow concentric rings or spots often appear on the fruit from infected plants. Potato virus Y (PVY) The most useful symptom for diagnosis is a mosaic pattern developing along the veins, commonly referred to as vein-banding. With early infection, plants are stunted, fruit-set is reduced and fruits are covered in distinct mosaic patterns making them unmarketable. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) Infected tomato plants initially show stunted and erect or upright plant growth; plants infected at an early stage of growth will show severe stunting. The critical symptom for diagnosis is when the leaves become small and curl upwards; they show strong crumpling and interveinal and marginal yellowing. The internodes of infected plants become shortened and growth is stunted, resulting in plants having a bushy appearance. Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and fall off (abscise). Fruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are infected at an early age. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) • Tomato. The symptoms appearing on leaves, petioles, stems and fruit vary, depending on the stage at which plants become infected. Young leaves may show small, dark brown spots and eventually die. Dark brown streaks appear on stems and leaf petioles. Growing tips are usually severely affected with systemic necrosis and greatly stunted growth. The plant may exhibit one- sided growth. Tomato fruit-set on severely infected plants displays very characteristic symptoms: immature fruits have mottled, light green rings with raised centres; the unique orange and red discoloration patterns on mature fruits make them unmarketable. • Pepper. The virus may cause sudden yellowing and browning of young leaves which later become necrotic. Long necrotic streaks appear on stems extending to the growing tips. Fruits formed after infection display large necrotic streaks and spots, while younger fruit may be completely necrotic. Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) In the early stage of infection, pale yellow spots develop on the leaves at the top of the plant. Stunting is common in the infected plants. In the late stage of infection, leaf mosaic and fruit mottling can be seen.

Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) Interveinal chlorotic spots appear on mature leaves. The yellow spots enlarge and may eventually coalesce, resulting in the yellowing of the entire leaf except for the veins which remain green. The leaves may roll up and turn brittle. Management of virus diseases Most viruses infecting vegetables are transmitted by sap-sucking insects. Weeds and other hosts are crucial in the life cycle of many viruses and their vectors. Infected plants cannot be cured: control involves the prevention or delay of infection. No single method is likely to provide perfect control, but if a combination of the management options are utilized, it can be possible to successfully implement disease control.

Reduction in virus inoculums level: • Control weeds and other virus hosts and insect vectors. • Destroy old crops promptly. • Separate new crops form maturing crops and avoid overlapping crops, especially continuous year-round cropping. Protection of the host: • Plant virus-resistant or virus-tolerant varieties. • Use highly reflective mulches and oil sprays to deter insects. • Use barrier crops and bare land to reduce vector activity. • Use insecticides strategically to protect plants from insects. 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 415 GENERAL PEST MANAGEMENT Monitoring Regular monitoring is the basis of all pest management programmes. A regular, weekly scouting programme should be conducted to detect problems at an early stage. Early detection and treatment lead to better pest control, since plant canopies are smaller and better spray coverage can be achieved. Blue and yellow sticky cards Use blue sticky cards to trap and detect adult stages of thrips and use yellow sticky cards for whiteflies and microlepidoptera. Place one to four cards per 100 m2. The cards should be spaced equally throughout the greenhouse in a grid pattern with additional cards located near doorways and vents. Place some cards just above the plant canopy (to detect thrips and whiteflies). Inspect and replace the cards weekly to keep track of population trends. Plant inspection Plant inspection is needed to assess general plant health and to detect diseases, mites and aphids, plus any hot spots of immature whiteflies. Randomly select plants at ten locations in an area of 100 m2, examining plants on each side of the aisle. Begin in a slightly different location each week, walking through the greenhouse in a zigzag pattern down the walkway. Examine the underside of leaves for insect pests and inspect root systems to determine whether they are healthy. Key plants and indicator plants Focus on scouting key plants and indicator plants: • Key plants are plants or cultivars with serious, persistent problems every year. For example, peppers, tomatoes and eggplants are prone to aphid infestations: look for aphids on young leaves and for shiny honeydew on the upper leaf surface. If grown near flowering plants, peppers, tomatoes and eggplant will have signs of an early thrips population: look for distorted, young leaves with silvery flecked scars – signs of thrips feeding damage. • Indicator plants are used to detect the presence of pests. For example, faba beans (Vicia faba L.) and certain petunia cultivars can detect the presence of thrips carrying TSWV. These plants will develop viral symptoms within one week if fed on by the infected thrips.

The petunia cultivar ‘Summer Madness’ and several varieties of faba bean have been successfully used to detect tospoviruses. Record-keeping and decision-making Each time the crop is scouted, record the pest numbers, their location and the number of plants inspected. Records of pest numbers and locations will help identify population trends. Population trends are an indication of whether initial GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 416 control measures were successful or need to be repeated. Once this information is collected each week, a pest management decision can be made. Monitoring and record-keeping help make the necessary treatment decisions by providing answers to the following questions: • Is the population decreasing, increasing or stable over the growing season? • Is spraying required? • Are insects migrating from weeds under the benches to the crops? • Is the previous week’s treatment working? Table 3 provides a list of selected means for managing diseases on greenhouse- grown vegetable transplants. Follow label instructions before using the material on vegetable plants. The product must be used only for crops for which the compound is registered. Biological control for insects and mites Biological control is an option for aphids, mites, fungus gnats, thrips, whiteflies and some lepidopters. Natural enemies are living organisms. They do not act as quickly as pesticides so cannot be used as “rescue” treatment. Natural enemies (parasitoids, predators of pathogens) are best used early in the cropping cycle when plants are small, pest numbers are low and damage is not yet observed. A detailed plan of action is needed to ensure success. Accurately identify the key pests in the production system. Natural enemies, especially parasites, are often specific to a particular pest. Many insecticide residues can adversely affect natural enemies for up to 3 months after application. Petunias and faba beans as indicator plants • Remove flowers from indicator plants to encourage feeding on foliage where symptoms can be observed. • Place a blue non-sticky card in each pot at plant height. The blue card will attract thrips to the indicator plant. • Place petunia plants throughout the greenhouse among the crop at a rate of one plant every 6–9 m and faba bean plants at a rate of 12 pots per 100 m2. • Remove symptomatic leaves on petunia plants and continue to use the plants. The virus is not systemic in these plants. Thrips feeding injury leaves distinct white feeding scars on the foliage. Virus symptoms appear as a brown rim around the feeding scars. • Remove entire plants of faba bean if symptoms are observed, because the virus is systemic in these plants. Viral symptoms appear as dark brown angular lesions on leaves or yellow to light green ring spots. Dark necrotic areas can also be seen on the stem. Faba beans have dark black spots on their stipules that should not be confused with viral symptoms. • Replace with new plants, planting 1–2 bean seeds per 10-cm pot. 15.

Koppert and Biobest have compiled lists of insecticides and their effects on natural enemies (www.koppert.com and www.biobest.be, respectively). Farmers and extension staff must become familiar with insecticides compatible with natural enemies, for example, insecticidal soap, horticultural oil, insect growth regulators, GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 418 neem-based materials (azadirachtin) and other “physical kill” products (propelene glycol alginate) (see Table 3); a specific sprayer should be dedicated for their use. Start in a small trial area (ideally, a separate greenhouse) to become familiar with the release, monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of natural enemies. Consult the supplier and a researcher to establish a schedule for the natural enemies’ introduction. Release rates and timing vary depending on the crop and its size, the degree of infestation, the effectiveness and the type of natural enemies, as well as the time of year. Starting a biological control programme will involve trial and error, as release rates have not been scientifically evaluated for vegetable plants. Vegetable plants with only one or two key insect pests or with a longer production schedule may be logical candidates for biological control. Natural enemies must be received from the supplier quickly (2–4 days) and kept cool during shipment; they should be inspected for viability and quality when received.

There follows a brief description of the major pests, including their life cycle and monitoring tips. See Tables 1 and 4 for additional scouting guidelines, registered pesticides and biological control options. Aphids Life cycle Several species of aphid can occur on vegetable transplants, but the most common are green peach, melon and foxglove. Aphids are small, 1.5 mm in length, round, soft-bodied insects, varying in colour from light green to pink or black. The green peach aphid is yellowish-green in summer, pink or yellowish in autumn and spring. Winged forms are brown with a large dusky blotch on the abdomen. Melon aphids are greenish-yellow to very dark green with black mottling and short dark cornicles (tubular structures on the posterior part of the abdomen). Foxglove aphids are smaller than potato aphids but larger than melon and green peach aphids. The foxglove aphid is a shiny light yellowish green to dark green with a pear-shaped body. The only markings on the bodies of wingless adults are dark green patches at the base of the cornicle. The legs and antennae also have black markings. Foxglove aphids cause more leaf distortion than green peach or melon aphids. Aphids feed by inserting their piercing, sucking mouth parts into the plant tissue and removing fluids. In greenhouses, aphids are usually females that produce live young called nymphs. Each female can produce 50 or more nymphs. Nymphs mature to adulthood and begin reproducing in as little as 7–10 days. Adults are usually wingless, but some produce wings when populations reach outbreak levels. Large numbers of aphids stunt and deform plants. In addition, aphids produce a sticky digestive by-product called honeydew, which can cover leaves and provide a food source for a superficial black fungus known as sooty mould. Aphids are present on weeds and may enter the greenhouse through vents. Monitoring Examine the foliage, stems and new growth of key plants such as peppers, eggplants, cole crops and leafy greens for early detection of aphid infestation. Signs of aphid activity include shedding of white skins, shiny honeydew, curled new leaves, distorted growth and the presence of ants. Yellow sticky cards help detect the entrance of winged aphids into the greenhouse from outdoors. Yellow cards will not, however, permit the monitoring of aphids within the crop, as most of the aphids will be wingless. Whiteflies Life cycle The silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia argentifolii) and greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) may infest vegetable plants; greenhouse whitefly is the most 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 421 common species. Both adult and immature whiteflies have piercing sucking mouthparts, are able to remove fluids and produce honeydew resulting in sooty mould fungus. Winged adult whiteflies are 1.5 mm in length and are found on the undersides of the youngest, most tender leaves. Females may lay 150–300 eggs, which hatch into first-instars nymphs in about a week. The crawlers move for a short distance before settling down to feed. After three moults, there is the pupa stage, from which adults emerge in about 6 days. Whiteflies complete their egg-to- adult cycle in 21–36 days depending on greenhouse temperature. Monitoring To monitor whiteflies, check susceptible plants, such as tomatoes, at ten locations in an area of 100 m2, examining plants on each side of the aisle. Look on the undersides of one or two leaves per plant, for nymphs, pupa and adults. Yellow sticky traps can also be used to detect adult whiteflies once populations have reached higher densities. Begin treatments as soon as the first sign of infestation is noted. Thrips Life cycle The most injurious species is the western flower thrip (WFT); the pests often do considerable damage before being discovered, because they are small, multiply rapidly and feed in plant buds in which they can", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Begin treatments as soon as the first sign of infestation is noted. Thrips Life cycle The most injurious species is the western flower thrip (WFT); the pests often do considerable damage before being discovered, because they are small, multiply rapidly and feed in plant buds in which they can remain undetected. WFT also vector tospoviruses. Feeding marks from the rasping mouth parts of thrips appear as white streaks on the leaves. Infested new growth may curl under and leaves are often deformed. Adult WFT are about 1.5 mm long, with narrow bodies and fringed wings. Females are reddish brown and males are light tan to yellow. The immature stages are light yellow. Female thrips insert eggs (several hundred per female) into plant tissue. The tiny yellowish larvae moult twice and feed on plant fluids as they mature. Larvae drop off the plant into the soil and pass through two stages, after which adults emerge. The egg-to-adult life cycle can be completed in 7–13 days depending on greenhouse temperature: development is more rapid under warm temperatures than under cool temperatures. Monitoring Early detection of a thrips infestation is critical for effective management because populations are lower and it is easier to obtain good coverage when plant canopies are small. Symptoms of feeding are often not noticed until the damage has occurred. Eggplant, tomatoes and peppers are especially prone to thrips infestations. Blue sticky cards, key plants and indicator plants are all effective for the detection of onset of an infestation. Yellow sticky cards should be placed just above the crop canopy, near doors and vents, and over thrip-sensitive cultivars to monitor the movement of the thrips. Recent research has shown that light to medium-blue sticky cards catch more thrips than yellow ones. However, it is more practical to use yellow cards for general pest monitoring to attract fungus gnats, GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 422 whiteflies and winged aphids. The number of thrips per card should be recorded and graphed weekly to monitor population levels and movement in or out of the greenhouse, and thus help make control decisions. Tomato borer Life cycle Tomato borer, Tuta absoluta, reproduces rapidly, with a life cycle of 24–38 days, depending on temperature. The minimum temperature for activity is 9 °C. The larval stage (caterpillar) does not enter diapause while food is available. During the life of one female, up to 250 eggs may be deposited on above-ground parts. Eggs hatch and the caterpillars mine inside the leaf, stem or fruit. There are four larval stages completed within 2–3 weeks. Pupation may take place in the soil or on the surface of a leaf, in a curled leaf or in a mine. The moths are active at night and hide between leaves during the day. The tomato borer came to the Near East region in 2006 and can cause extensive damage; it has a strong preference for tomato and can cause 50–100 percent yield reduction. Larvae can infest any part of the plant above the ground at any stage of the crop. The most distinctive symptoms are the blotch-shaped mines in the leaves; in the case of serious infection, leaves die off completely. Damage to fruits allows fungal diseases to enter, leading to rotting fruit before or after harvest. Monitoring Use special sex pheromone traps to detect the first presence of the moth inside and outside the greenhouse. Check plants for the first appearance of mines. Spider mites Life cycle Two-spotted spider mites can be found on vegetable plants. Adult females are approximately 0.5 mm long, and slightly orange in colour. All mobile stages are able to pierce plant tissue with their mouth parts and remove plant fluids. Most spider mites are found on the underside of leaves. Feeding injury often gives leaf surfaces a mottled or speckled, dull appearance. Leaves then turn yellow and drop. Large populations produce visible webbing that can completely cover the leaves. Eggs are laid singly, up to 100 per female, during her 3–4-week life span; they then hatch into larvae in as few as 3 days. Following a brief larval stage, several nymphal stages occur before adults appear. The egg-to-adult cycle can be", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Following a brief larval stage, several nymphal stages occur before adults appear. The egg-to-adult cycle can be completed in 7–14 days depending upon temperature. Hot and dry conditions favour spider mite development. Monitoring Mites often develop as localized infestations on particular groups of plants such as beans, tomatoes or eggplants. Adult mites are not found on sticky cards and it is necessary to examine foliage to check for the presence of mites: turn over the 15. Integrated pest management and plant hygiene under protected cultivation 423 leaves of sample plants and, with a hands-free magnifier (Optivisor) or hand lens, check for the presence of spider mites. Cyclamen mites Life cycle Shiny, orange-tinted cyclamen mites prefer to hide in buds or deep within flowers. Adult females can lay 2–3 eggs per day for up to 2–3 weeks. Eggs are deposited in moist places at the base of the plant. Cyclamen mites can complete their life cycle in 1–3 weeks. Females can live up to 1 month and can reproduce without mating. Cyclamen mite females lay 2–3 eggs per day for up to 2–3 weeks. Cyclamen mite eggs are oval, smooth and about half the size of the adult female. Larvae hatch from the eggs in 3–7 days. The slow-moving white larvae feed for 4–7 days. Cyclamen mites prefer high relative humidity and temperatures of 15 °C. Cyclamen mites feed upon many ornamental bedding plants including dahlia, fuchsia, gerbera daisy, petunias and viola, as well as strawberries in the field. They may migrate to peppers or tomatoes. Monitoring Cyclamen mites pierce tissue with their mouth parts and suck out the cell contents. Signs of damage may be concentrated near the buds or over the entire plant. Symptoms include inward curling of the leaves, puckering and crinkling. Pit-like depressions may develop. The mite is only 0.25 mm long and examination under a microscope is often needed to confirm the presence of cyclamen mites. Broad mites Life cycle Broad mites are closely related to cyclamen mites. They can be distinguished from cyclamen mites in their egg stage. Eggs are covered with bumps that look like a row of diamonds and they are best seen using a dissecting microscope. Adults and larvae are smaller than cyclamen mites and walk rapidly on the underside of leaves. Broad mites can also attach themselves to whiteflies and use the whiteflies as a carrier for their dispersal. The development of broad mites is favoured by high temperatures (21–26 °C). Broad mites can complete their life cycle in as little as 1 week. Females lay 30–75 eggs. Monitoring Broad mites can affect various ornamentals, including gerbera daisy, New Guinea Impatiens, salvia, ivy, verbena and zinnia, and may migrate to peppers or tomatoes. Characteristic damage includes leaf edges curling downwards or dying terminal buds. As they feed, broad mites inject toxic saliva, resulting in twisted, distorted growth. Broad mite injury should not be confused with with herbicide injury, nutritional (boron) deficiencies or physiological disorders. Inspect the underside of the leaves with a 20× hand lens for the mites and their eggs.

Integrated pest management Abdelhaq Hanafi Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Saudi Arabia INTRODUCTION This chapter discusses aspects of integrated pest management as part of GAP, highlighting cultural techniques relevant to pest and disease management (at nursery level and in the production greenhouse), physical control, mechanical control, general hygiene and specific sanitary measures, host plant resistance, greenhouse worker training, crop and pest monitoring, and biological and chemical control of pests and diseases. Finally, general guidelines are provided with recommendations regarding successful application of an IPM programme in line with GAP standards. Pest and disease control is probably the greenhouse crop practice with the greatest impact not only on the environment and human health, but also on public opinion in recent years. As agriculture under protected cultivation develops, plants become more susceptible to pests for several reasons, including monoculture cultivation and the use of selected, high-yielding varieties which sometimes stimulate pest and disease development. Various control methods have been developed and new methods incorporated into the production system. Control methods may be classified as non-chemical or chemical, as preventive or curative. Most frequently used methods: • Cultural control: adoption of cultural practices during crop production. • Host plant resistance: use of a plant’s capacity to avoid or repel attack by pests (cultivar or rootstock). • Biological control: use of living organisms (insect and mite predators, insect and nematode parasitoids, microbial agents [viruses, bacteria, fungi etc.]). • Other biologically based control: use of chemical stimuli (pheromones) or plant extracts. • Mechanical control: use of insect nets as mechanical barriers, colour sticky bands or light traps. • Physical control: exploitation of solar heat energy to destroy pests in the greenhouse environment, in both soil and substrates. • Chemical control: use of synthetic and non-synthetic chemical compounds. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 428 During the past 60 years, pest control has been based largely on the use of synthetic chemical pesticides, but the beginning of the twenty-first century saw a major change in crop protection, with biologically based technologies replacing or used in integration with conventional synthetic chemical pesticides. Some biologically based technologies already account for a significant part of the crop protection market, particularly with regard to host-plant resistance to pests and diseases and biological control. This approach – using other control measures instead of only relying on chemical control – is known as integrated pest management (IPM). In 1997, the concept was extended to “integrated production and pest management” (IPPM), incorporating a range of practices: crop rotation, cultivation, fertilization, pesticide use, cultural control measures, biological control and other alternatives to conventional chemical control. IPPM is a sustainable, environmentally and economically justifiable system: damage caused by pests, diseases and weeds is prevented by natural factors and adoption of good agricultural practices (GAP), limiting population growth of these organisms and, where necessary, including also appropriate control measures.

IPM in protected cultivation The occurrence, development and control of pests and diseases under greenhouse structures is undoubtedly influenced by the fact that the crops are enclosed. The complex control systems of modern greenhouses are designed to maintain an ideal environment for the crop, both economically and physiologically. These conditions also provide a protected, favourable environment for pests and pathogens: optimal humidity and temperature, no rain and no wind. Pests and pathogens may therefore be more prolific and cause more damage to their hosts IPM IPM as defined by FAO, is an ecosystem approach to crop production and protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides. FAO promotes IPM as the preferred approach to crop protection and regards it as a pillar of both sustainable intensification of crop production and pesticide risk reduction. As such, IPM is being mainstreamed in FAO activities involving crop production and protection. The FAO IPM programme currently comprises three regional programmes (Asia, Near East and West Africa) and several stand-alone national projects. Under these programmes and projects, FAO provides assistance in capacity-building and policy reform, and facilitates collaboration among ongoing national IPM programmes. 16. Integrated pest management 429 in greenhouses than in open field conditions. Moreover, compared with open field cultivation, natural enemies may be scarce or entirely absent, unless accidentally or purposefully introduced; on the other hand, the stability of the greenhouse environment allows natural enemies of pests to be used as an effective means of control. As crop cultivation methods become more advanced, pest and disease control must evolve accordingly. A number of radical new systems for growing plants (e.g. soilless systems) have been introduced in recent years. When a cultivation method changes, pest and disease organisms become exposed to a new ecosystem. This in turn may require changes to be made in the traditional methods of control. There are other reasons why greenhouses require exceptional crop protection measures. Rotation cannot normally be practised in greenhouses, due to economic factors related to the high level of expertise required for commercial success. Consequently, the same crop or crops are grown year after year; particular care must therefore be exercised, especially regarding pests which persist in the soil or on the structure of the greenhouse itself. As the value of greenhouse crops is usually high, expensive control measures may be economically justified to achieve the high standards of pest and disease control required. In general, when choosing and applying pesticides for greenhouse crops, greater care is required to avoid phytoxic effects or pesticide residues. Chemical control may easily be applied in prophylactic treatments when a clean crop is needed (e.g. ornamentals). Ornamentals have a high aesthetic value and a damaged flower is unstable; they lose their value even at a low level of infestation or when exported to countries with zero-tolerance regulations for certain pest organisms. With most other crops, however, some infestation can usually be tolerated, as it leads to little or no damage. At present, IPM is seen as the standard for modern crop protection technology. Compared with other sectors, more of the new, non-chemical control techniques are already being used in greenhouses as part of IPM programmes. A multifaceted approach to greenhouse crop protection, with integration of chemical, cultural, biological, mechanical and physical control of pests and diseases, will be more successful and make adaptive changes in pests and pathogens less likely. In northern Europe, IPM is currently used in over 95 percent of greenhouse vegetable and ornamental production area. In the particular case of Morocco, IPM adoption in greenhouse vegetable farms has increased from 5 ha in 1999 to 4 230 ha in 2011. In terms of the percentage of greenhouse area adopting IPM in Morocco, tomato is by far the leading crop (61.4%), followed by pepper (22.4%), strawberries (10.6%) and green beans (2.6%).

IPM has become the general crop protection policy in greenhouse crops, and is the wise answer to the overuse of chemical pesticides. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 430 PREVENTIVE MEASURES A wide range of reduction methods may be applied, depending on the type of crop and the region of production. Before the emergence of chemical control, cultural control was important in greenhouse crop protection. Today, growers are so specialized that important cultural control methods such as crop rotation are not popular in protected crops. Moreover, methods such as mixed cropping, multiple and intercropping and trap cropping are seldom used in greenhouses. Prevention of pest introduction and mechanical/physical control may be considered part of cultural control, and these practices are often applied in greenhouses. Mechanical control was initially based on the removal of weeds and infested parts of plants (e.g. removal of mines with leafminer larvae). In recent years, however, it has come to include use of fine mesh insect nets on all aeration openings of the greenhouse as well as the establishment of safety access systems (SAS) for the exclusion of pests and vectors. Physical control is applied to disinfect the soil. Another form of cultural control is the management of the crop’s environment to prevent or reduce diseases through computer models designed to predict the optimal greenhouse climate for production of a crop while taking disease control into account. Host plant resistance to disease is widely used; plant resistance to insects and nematodes is increasingly the focus of research and development. While it can be impossible to eradicate a recently invasive pest and the costs involved are very high, eradication is still easier in the greenhouse than in the open field. Inspection and quarantine Pests evolve to their fullest extent in the centres of origin of specific crop plants. Many pests are, therefore, localized in specific areas, and it is in the general interest of agriculture to limit their distribution. Crop species sometimes extend to new areas initially unaccompanied by many of their pests and pathogens, and these crops therefore produce well in the new areas. However, much of this advantage is slowly lost as pests and pathogens tend to follow the crop sooner or later. In order to prevent or diminish the risk of exotic pest species becoming endemic, there are extensive rules and guidelines concerning the health conditions of imported plant material. Control of pests and diseases through legislation is extremely important and health certificates are required by plant protection services in many countries. Measures at greenhouse level In greenhouses, rotavators are used to prepare the soil: they produce very fine soil particles, resulting in high germination of weed seeds. Black and white plastic mulching – whether applied locally (localized mulching) on rows or all over the ground of the greenhouse (total mulching) – is an important way of controlling weeds and some insect pests (thrips, leafminers etc.). Other sanitary measures during the growing period include removal by hand before the weeds set seed. 16.

In the past, seeds were purposefully harvested from plants with fewer symptoms of diseases or pests, resulting in some level of field resistance. Today, commercial breeding’s interest in enhanced production and cultural quality, combined with the use of pesticides on the selection fields, has resulted in susceptible varieties. Host- plant resistance against insects still requires further development, while resistance against diseases is already highly developed for many cultivars. The use of disease-resistant cultivars is, in theory, the easiest and most convenient way to achieve disease control; ideally, cultivars should be resistant to all the crop’s diseases. In reality, however, there are very few crops where even a small proportion of the cultivars are resistant to more than a small number of diseases. Tomato is one of these: over 70 diseases are known to occur in tomato and there are some cultivars resistant to just four of them – tomato mosaic virus (TMV), leaf mould, Verticillum wilt and Fusarium wilt. Unfortunately, many Plate 1 Example of complete mulching of the greenhouse floor preventing weeds and acting as mechanical barrier to certain insect (leafminers, thrips, Tuta absoluta and other lepidopteran pests) life stages preventing them from moving to the soil for pupation (life cycle interruption) Plate 2 On-row mulching preventing weed competition for nutrients with the crop GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 432 pathogens exist as strains, each with different virulence genes, so that a cultivar may be resistant or tolerant to some but not all strains of the pathogen. Resistant cultivars usually remain disease-free for only a short time, because more new strains of the pathogen evolve, or because the pathogen population is a mixture of many different strains with one or more predominating at any one time. The balance of strains of the pathogen often responds quickly to changes in the host population. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether a pathogen population is a mixture of different strains with some present in extremely low proportions or whether the pathogen produces virulent mutants at infrequent intervals which are normally lost from the population unless there is a suitable resistant host present on which they can grow. Sometimes such mutants, although able to grow on resistant cultivars, are not as able to compete with other strains and do not survive because they are less fit. But for various reasons, some newly introduced resistant cultivars rapidly lose their resistance. A more logical approach, albeit more difficult and time consuming, is to combine as many genes as possible into each cultivar. Resistance of this type will only break down if the pathogen produces a complex race capable of overcoming all the resistant genes at once. Some plant breeders have followed this approach by combining all the known sources of TMV resistance into tomato cultivars. These cultivars have been grown commercially for a number of years and so far no TMV strain capable of overcoming their resistance has been found. Resistance as an IPM component remains the most effective way of combating viral diseases. Resistant varieties exist for a number of viruses. However, complete and durable resistance is difficult to achieve in breeding programmes. Nevertheless, pests and diseases may adapt to host plant resistance, a process comparable to the adaptation of pests to pesticides. In particular, adaptation occurs when resistance is high, inheritance is simple, and the resistant cultivar is grown widely. Therefore, knowledge about the variability of the pest or pathogen species involved is necessary. Fortunately, resistance to insects often tends to be partial and its inheritance polygenic, so that selection of biotypes adapted to resistance is less likely. However, recent developments in resistance breeding, such as the breeding of transgenic plants carrying toxic genes from Bacillus thuringiensis, tend to focus on monogenic factors with a very high expression.

A biological control project plan is presented, as well as a procedure to evaluate natural enemies prior to their introduction. 16. Integrated pest management 433 The emphasis is on insects and mites as target organisms for biological control. The principles of biological control for plant pathogens are outlined where they differ from insects and mites; other pest organisms (nematodes, viruses and weeds) are treated only briefly as development in these areas, at least for greenhouse crops, is lagging behind. Definition The term “biological control” has been applied to include virtually all pest control measures excluding the application of chemical pesticides. Nowadays, however, it is generally agreed that the term should be defined as “the use of living organisms as pest control agents”, implying human intervention. • Natural control: in nature, potential pests are kept at low densities by their natural enemies. • Biological control: natural enemies are relatively large organisms (e.g. spiders, predatory bugs or parasitic wasps). • Microbial control: natural enemies are micro-organisms (e.g. bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes or viruses). • Biotechnical control: pheromonal attraction, genetic control with the sterile male technique, chemical control with juvenile hormones and host-plant resistance are all biotechnical techniques. The term biotechnical control is similar to biorational or biologically based control. Genetic control and control with attractants, repellents, anti-feedants and pheromones (a special category of attractants) are not commonly used in greenhouses. History of biological control in greenhouse crops Successful greenhouse production requires well-trained growers who are not prepared to risk damage from insects for ideological reasons: if chemical control works better and is cheaper they will certainly use it. Despite this, biological pest control has been applied in greenhouses with commercial success for about 45 years. Growers readily accepted its introduction and now rely on it. The main reason for the rapid development of biological control methods was the occurrence of resistance against pesticides in several key greenhouse pests. In the past 45 years, over 30 species of natural enemies have been introduced against more than 22 pest species. The greenhouse area on which biological control is applied has increased from 400 ha in 1970 to over 50 000 ha today. Biological control of key pests in greenhouses is currently applied in more than 25 countries out of a total of 35 countries with a greenhouse industry. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 434 Biological and microbial control agents Modern biological control depends on the use of specific natural enemies of the target pest, carefully selected and screened to eliminate species which could pose a threat to other useful organisms. Predators Individual predators consume a number of prey during their lifetime and actively seek their food. Some species are polyphagous and consume a wide range of prey; others are oligaphagous (narrow range) or monophagous (extreme specialists). Polyphagous arthropod predators do not concentrate their attention on target pests and tend to feed on the most abundant and easily captured prey. Monophagous and oligaphagous predators are more likely to be suitable for biological control. Many different species of predators are used in greenhouse biological control programmes. Parasitoids These insects (many of which are monophagous) develop parasitically in a single host which is eventually killed. They include a remarkably diverse group of small wasps and flies, with about 300 000 described species. The adults are free-living and highly mobile, and can actively search for hosts in/on which to lay eggs. The larvae live in (endoparasitoid) or on a host (ectoparasitoid) until they are fully grown (egg, larvae and pupal stage); they generally kill their host at the moment of pupation. A number of parasitoid species are used for pest control in greenhouses. Pathogens Parasitic micro-organisms will often kill their host outright. Dead hosts liberate millions of individual microbes, which are dispersed by the wind and vectors. With protazoans, the effect on pests is generally more long term. Pathogens are easily mass-produced, and release methods are similar to", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Pathogens are easily mass-produced, and release methods are similar to the application of chemical pesticides. Bacteria Almost all bacteria in microbial insecticides currently in production are species of the genus Bacillus. There are other bacteria which are pathogenic to insects, but they are also potentially harmful to man or difficult to mass produce. In most cases, bacteria affect their hosts after being ingested with food, often producing toxic metabolites that damage the gut wall. The best known and most successful species is B. thuringiensis (Bt). The time from ingestion of a lethal dose to death varies from hours to one or two days. However, even at sublethal doses, the insect stops feeding within hours. Its toxin is extensively used in greenhouse biocontrol to control caterpillars, and has been involved in the development of several transgenic plants (essentially field crops) with resistance to key lepidopteran and coleopteran pests. 16. Integrated pest management 435 Viruses Viruses are not free-living and can only replicate in living host cells. There are at least seven families of viruses containing insect-pathogenic representatives. The Baculoviridae family is unique in that it is exclusive to invertebrates and they bear no resemblance, structural or biochemical, to invertebrate pathogens. In terms of safety and thanks to their pesticidal potential, Baculoviruses are particularly suitable for biological control. Baculoviridae can be applied to control insect pests caused by the larvae of Lepidoptera. The larvae die 4–8 days after infection, and millions of virus particles are set free by the putrefying cadaver. In greenhouses, an NPV (nuclear polyhedrosis virus) is used to control larvae of Spodoptera exigua. Although many of these viruses are rapidly inactivated by UV radiation between 280 and 320 nm, this portion of the light spectrum is absorbed by glass and plastic sheet, and the application of viruses can be very successful in greenhouses. Fungi Fungi are the only insect pathogens capable of invading the insect by penetrating the cuticle – the most common means of infection. Therefore, those insects that feed by sucking, such as aphids and scales, are attacked only by fungal pathogens. As a result, fungi are very dependent on environmental conditions, in particular high humidity, to achieve infection. Most fungi successes have been with Deuteromycetes, which cause epizootic on foliage-feeding insects in tropical environments only. In greenhouses, two fungal products are applied against whiteflies: Verticillium lecanii and Aschersonia aleyrodis; the more general fungus, V. Lecanii, is also used for control of aphids and thrips. Nematodes The most promising nematodes belong to the family Steinernematidae – Heterorhabditis and Steinernema (Neoplectana). They are characterized by their association with a bacteria of the Xenorhabdus genus. The infective juveniles carry mutualistic bacteria in their intestines, and on entering the insect host (through natural openings), they release the bacterial cells that propagate and kill the insect within 48 hours. These nematodes are virulent, kill hosts quickly and are easily mass-produced in vivo and in vitro; they have a very broad host range. Both groups are used in greenhouse biocontrol programmes. Methods of release of biological agents Parasitoids, predators and pathogens can be used in different types of biological control programmes, described below. Inoculative biological control Beneficial organisms are collected in an exploration area and introduced and released (in limited numbers only) where there is a pest occurrence. The method aims for long-term suppression of pest populations and is typically used against introduced pests, presumed to have arrived in a new area without their GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 436 natural enemies (which are then sought in the pest’s area of origin). The first widely practised form of biological control, it is also known as “classical” biological control.

No examples exist for greenhouse crops, as permanent biocontrol is impossible in protected cultivation: the crop, its pests and natural enemies are removed from the structure at the end of each growing season. Inundative biological control Indigenous or exotic beneficial organisms are mass-reared in the laboratory or acquired from specialized biological control companies and periodically released in large numbers in order to obtain immediate control of pests for one or two generations (i.e. use as biotic insecticide), with no anticipation of the potential effects on subsequent generations. An example of this approach is the frequent application of high numbers of predatory mites (Amblyseius spp.) against thrips (Frankliniella sp.) in protected cultivation. Seasonal inoculative biological control Native or exotic natural enemies are mass reared or acquired from the international market and periodically released in short-term crops (3–10 months) against pests, and the control effects are expected to last several generations. A large number of natural enemies are released – for an immediate control effect, plus a buildup of the natural enemy population for control later in the season. This method is essentially different from inundative control, because it aims to achieve a control effect over several generations and therefore resembles inoculative control. An illustration of this technique is the biological control of the recently introduced invasive species Tuta absoluta to Europe (2006), North Africa (2008) and the Near East (2009–10), with the exotic (originally from Latin America) parasitic wasp Trichogramma acheae. Conservation Conservation is an indirect method where measures are taken to conserve natural enemies; it may result in a richer diversity of beneficial species as well as in larger populations of each species, leading to better control of pests. For example, where parasitoids of leafminers and aphids occur naturally in the fields surrounding greenhouses, they may immigrate into protected structures and give adequate control. Proper management of the crops and the surroundings of greenhouses may therefore stimulate or restore natural control.

Integrated pest management 437 How to implement a biological control programme Planning the biological control programme A programme description is made, in which both the taxonomic and the noxious status of the target organism (pest animal or weed) are defined. Information is collected, through literature research and correspondence, concerning the biology of the pest and its natural enemies. If an appropriate natural enemy is not available in the international market, exploration is undertaken and an inventory of natural enemies started, with attention to aspects of genetic diversity of the natural enemy and collection of a sufficient quantity of specimens. A natural enemy’s importance in the exploration area is determined by studying host range and negative characteristics (e.g. hyperparasitic habits, poliphagy). On the basis of these data, an initial selection can be made of species for future studies. Although studies in the exploration area cannot usually be relied on to predict whether or not a new natural enemy species will become established or effective in a new environment, they help discover whether an agent is clearly unsuitable for particular areas. Following initial selection, a detailed study is carried out of the promising species.

When it is difficult, but essential, to distinguish the natural enemy from the pest (host), the only solution is to introduce adults. Release of adult parasitoids is not recommended as handling and release are extremely difficult, often resulting in a reduction in fertility compared with parasitoids released when immature. Release of natural enemies There are a variety of methods for introduction in the greenhouse. Eggs and pupae may be distributed over the greenhouse on their normal substrate (leaves of the host plant, e.g. Chrysoperla and Encarsia) or glued on paper or cardboard cards (e.g. Encarsia, Trichogramma, Eretmocerus). At these stages, natural enemies can also be collected and put into containers, which are then brought into the greenhouse (e.g. Nesidiocorris). Natural enemies at a mobile stage (larvae, nymphs or adults) can be placed in the greenhouse in containers (e.g. many adult parasitoids and predators) or the grower can distribute or sprinkle them over the plants. Biological control companies, distributors and extension services should be consulted for advice concerning: correct handling (especially after pick-up from airport on arrival of shipment); timely delivery (time between airport and farm delivery); and release (practical handling of containers) of the beneficial insects. However, in countries only recently adopting this technology, sufficient advice on biological control applications is seldom available – a weak point in the chain of biological control. Risks of biological control Current knowledge indicates that the negative effects of chemical pesticide use outweigh the risks associated with biological control. The risks of using natural enemies for pest control are nevertheless discussed here. Environmental risks No insect natural enemies used for biological control of insect pests are directly harmful to humans. They may, however, create risks for the environment (e.g. attacking other useful organisms). Many species are transferred from one world region to another. Although potential natural enemies are screened for possible negative effects in the area of introduction, it can never be predicted with absolute Plate 5 Release of Nesidiocorris tenuis with additional food supplement (Ephestia eggs) (FAO Projects UTF/SAU/025 and 038/SAU, Saudi Arabia) 16. Integrated pest management 439 certainty that a natural enemy will not change its behaviour and attack other beneficial organisms or innocuous inhabitants of the same environment. No cases are known of insect natural enemies changing host spectrum after reducing the pest population to levels much below that of economic importance. Usually, low populations of natural enemy and host result and co-exist for long periods. The special dietary requirements and behaviour of natural enemies virtually exclude the possibility of them becoming pests themselves (with the exception of some natural enemies, e.g. Nesidiocorris tenuis, which can cause tomato fruit damage at high population levels towards the end of the crop cycle). Risks of resistance With regard to resistance, several defence mechanisms exist for a host to escape from parasitism or predation. Besides behavioural defence (searching for a hiding place, strong body movements to prevent attack, spitting etc.) and morphological defence (e.g. development of a thick cuticle), many host species possess an internal defence mechanism against parasitoids: the encapsulation of parasitoid eggs. The development of complete host resistance towards a parasitoid species is extremely rare in biological control, although encapsulation occurs widely among many groups of insects. The frequent development by pests of resistance to insecticide compounds is a phenomenon which has not been observed in natural enemies during the past 45 years. It is presumed that the co-evolution of natural enemies and hosts will prevent development of complete resistance of pests to their enemies. Under strong parasitoid pressure, there is constant host selection for the capability to encapsulate parasitoid eggs. There is also constant selection for parasitoids with the ability to escape from encapsulation. This reciprocal selection process does not, of course, exist in a pesticide–host relationship.

PRACTICAL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF INSECTS AND MITES Biological control, including seasonal inoculative releases and techniques to increase and conserve natural enemies, is used against major greenhouse pests and some diseases. The decision threshold and the rate of natural enemies required for the control of different pests are generally provided by companies that commercialize biological control agents. Whiteflies Biological control of T. vaporariorum with seasonal inoculative releases of the parasitoid, Encarsia formosa, is widely used in greenhouses in temperate areas and to a lesser extent in warmer regions. However, Plate 6 Adult Macrolophus caliginosus KOPPERT BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, NL GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 440 E. formosa is not very efficient under cool, cloudy conditions, and inoculative release of the predator, Macrolophus caliginosus, is a complementary measure. In fact, the inoculation of both natural enemies is now used in many greenhouses where formerly only E. formosa was released. Initial populations of T. vaporariorum are usually higher in warm than in cold areas. Whitefly migration between crops occurs, necessitating higher densities of natural enemies, but for shorter growing seasons E. formosa does not control B. tabaci sufficiently in winter greenhouse crops. At present, a combination of the predatory mite, Amblyseius swirski, the predatory bug, Nesidiocorris tenuis, and the parasitoids, Eretmocerus eremicus and E. mundus, are applied to control T. vaporariorum and B. tabaci in greenhouse crops in warm regions. Leafminers Inoculative releases of Diglyphus isaea are done commercially for biological control of leafminers in greenhouse crops. In cold areas it is applied together with Dacnusa sibirica. In warm areas, natural populations of leafminer parasitoids are abundant year round and natural parasitism (up to 80%) controls leafminers for free. Further releases of D. isaea are made only when natural parasitism is low, especially when fine mesh screens are applied to the greenhouse. Aphids Suitable natural enemies are available to control all the aphid species that attack greenhouse crops, including the parasitoid Aphidius colemani and predators such as Aphidoletes aphidimiyza and Chrysoperla carnea. Indeed, in warmer regions, in greenhouses not using broad-spectrum insecticides or fine mesh screens, aphids do Plate 7 The adult parasitoid Eretmocerus sp. parasitizing a whitefly pupa INRA, FRANCE Plate 8 Adult Bemisia tabaci – a vector of over 30 plant viruses of greenhouse crops Plate 9 Adults of the parasitoid Diglyphus isea, immediately after release in the greenhouse for biological control of leafminers Plate 10 Mommies of the insect pest Aphis gossypii, parasitized with the parasitoid Aphidius colemani, released earlier in the season 16. Integrated pest management 441 not normally reach economic thresholds, due to the presence of indigenous populations of their natural enemies. Mites Biological control of spider mites with Phytoseiulus persimilis on tomato crops has been largely ineffective and is not widely employed. However, a new species of predatory mite Amblyseius swirski and a new strain of P. persimilis (T strain) have produced better results in greenhouse tomatoes. Caterpillars Chrysodeixis chalcites, Autographa gamma and Spodoptera littoralis are kept well under control by Bacillus thuringiensis treatments. Helicoverpa armigera is also well controlled if the treatment is applied when eggs or young larvae are present. Inoculative releases of the parasitoid Trichogramma evanescens are also made for biological control of C. chalcites in some greenhouse crops.

For biological control to succeed, growers must be guided by producers and distributors of natural enemies, and by extension service personnel in the adequate integration of pesticides. Plate 11 Damage to pepper leaves by the insect pest Chrysodeixis chalcites (Lepidoptera) Plate 12 Damage to tomato fruit by the insect pest Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 442 There is every reason to believe that the rapid rise in the use of bumblebees for pollination in recent years encouraged the application of biological control, as large spectrum toxic pesticides could not be integrated with the use of bees. Biological control and host-plant resistance Tritrophic systems involving host plant, pest and natural enemies have been studied only recently. Such studies are essential for discovering the plant’s role in supporting the action of natural enemies (whether combined with host-plant resistance or not), and how it might be manipulated to the benefit of natural enemies. Particularly in systems where natural enemies alone are not sufficiently effective, it is important to improve the enemies’ action through host-plant manipulation. It is generally accepted that insect resistance in plants is compatible with biological control, but there are cases demonstrating the opposite. Breeding for insect resistance changes plant characteristics, affecting both herbivorous and entomophagous species. Only by understanding the biological processes between the different trophic levels is it possible to manipulate host-plant characteristics to maximize the combined control resulting from plant resistance and biological control. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF DISEASES AND IPM Until recently, IPM was limited to the control of insects and mites. In northern Europe, the Mediterranean region and the Near East, there are many disease problems, particularly in tomatoes, cucumbers and cut flowers. While some fungicides integrate well with the use of natural enemies, there are nevertheless increasing resistance-related problems. Furthermore, the limited number of biological control agents for diseases is a major concern. Biological control of microbial plant pathogens As with insect control, there are numerous problems in the chemical control of plant pathogens. Non-chemical control methods are sought because of pathogen resistance to fungicides and concern for the environment. Several diseases have developed resistance to a range of fungicides. In protected crops, resistance occurs mainly with Botrytis cinerea and powdery mildew fungi. Recently, with the increase in biological pest control, especially in protected crops, another disadvantage of fungicides has emerged: their side-effects on beneficial insects. Plate 13 Bumblebees leave dark spots after pollinating a tomato flower, permitting the evaluation of the efficacy of pollination (flowers pollinated should be above 95% of flowers visited during all tomato flowering period) 16. Integrated pest management 443 History of biological control of plant pathogens Biological control of plant pathogens is a common phenomenon in nature and has been the subject of research for many years. As early as 1920, a number of reports highlighted the biological control of soil-borne diseases by antagonistic micro- organisms; it was understood that disease organisms became more abundant in sterilized soil than in soil with a resident micro-organism population or in sterilized soil with added antagonistic micro-organisms. In recent years, there have been extensive studies of antagonistic micro- organisms against foliar and soil-borne diseases. Several successful antagonists have been isolated, but only a few are commercially available today for various reasons: • Many diseases can still be effectively controlled by cheap and reliable fungicides and the disadvantages of fungicides – development of resistance, increasing developmental costs for new fungicides, and harmful effects on the environment, growers and non-target organisms – have only recently become more apparent. • Both the pathogen and the biocontrol agent are more influenced by environmental conditions than in biological control. • In many countries biological control agents of plant pathogens require registration before they can be used by growers, and the development of a commercial product costs more than for biological control of insects.

Mechanisms of biological control of plant pathogens Biological control can be based on several different mechanisms, effective against different stages in the pathogen’s life cycle. Competition New, young host surfaces are initially more or less sterile and can become colonized by both pathogenic and saprophytic micro-organisms. Rapid colonization of the surface by a saprophytic micro-organism may lead to depletion of the nutrients on the host surface. Fungal pathogen spores or pathogenic bacteria then arrive in an environment which is not conducive to their development. Inhibition of fungal pathogens in this situation can lead to a reduced rate of germination of pathogenic spores or to a reduced growth of germ tubes on the host surface. This leads to a reduction in the number of penetration points of the host surface and thereby to a reduction in symptoms such as the number of lesions. This is followed by a reduction of sporulation, which slows the spread of the disease. Biological control based on competition is only effective against pathogens that use external nutrients during their pre-penetration phase (e.g. Pythium). This excludes all biotrophic fungal pathogens such as powdery mildews or rusts. In biological control based on competition, it is unlikely that resistance of the GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 444 pathogen will develop. It is important to ensure rapid colonization of the host tissue before arrival of the pathogen (for example in the case of Bacillus subtilis); once penetration has been established, the pathogen is no longer controlled by this mechanism and growth of the pathogen in the host tissue will take place at a normal rate. Antibiosis Plant pathogens can be biologically controlled through the production of antibiotic substances by the antagonist, inhibiting pathogen growth. Some fungal pathogens (e.g. Fusarium) are usually less susceptible to antibiotics than others. Antibiotics can be produced by both bacterial and fungal antagonists. Antibiotic- producing antagonists are found more often in soil than on above-ground plant parts. The antibiotics can be effective against both necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens during several stages of their life cycle. Antibiotics will diffuse on the host surface, thereby making direct contact between the antagonist and the pathogen unnecessary. Two problems may occur in biological control based on antibiotic production: the pathogen may become resistant to the antibiotics (as with fungicides), and the antibiotics may be harmful to non-target organisms, including humans. Hyperparasitism Biological control based on hyperparasitism is a fairly common phenomenon in nature. In particular, powdery mildew fungi are often colonized by hyperparasites which feed directly on the plant pathogen. Biological control based on this mechanism does not require the biocontrol agent to be present before the pathogen arrives. On the contrary, since the hyperparasite usually needs the pathogenic fungus to feed on, this mechanism requires a certain level of infection by the pathogen before it can be effective. This is the main disadvantage of this mechanism of biological control: even low levels of infection may cause severe losses and therefore this method may not be attractive to growers. When the hyperparasite is applied, it needs to make direct contact with the pathogen to be effective, and distribution of the biocontrol agent over the host surface is important. The applicability of this method depends on the level of disease which can be tolerated without severe losses; therefore detailed knowledge of the relationship between yield loss and disease is needed. Induced resistance With induced resistance the host’s defence mechanisms recognize and respond to the biocontrol agent as if it were a pathogen, and are then prepared for the real threat posed by the later arrival of the actual pathogen (for example induced resistance to plant viruses). It is somewhat similar to vaccination in animals. Stimulation of the host plant’s defence must take place before the arrival of the pathogen; therefore the biocontrol agent has to be applied at an early stage of plant growth. In this mechanism, the biocontrol agent has no direct effect on 16.

This makes it more difficult to determine the effect of one biocontrol agent against a disease which can occur on various hosts, since the hosts may differ in their response. Application of biological control agents Application can aim at different modes of action and targets. Biological control agents can be applied on the aerial plant parts, in the soil, on seeds, on seedlings (e.g. on the roots), on harvested products and on crop residues. Practical manipulated biocontrol of leaf diseases is rarely applied, as there are few biological control agents registered against foliar diseases. Soil application focuses on reduction of inoculum, whereas seed application primarily aims at reducing infection. Soil treatment can be achieved by adding spore suspensions of antagonists to unsterilized soils. To prevent soil fungi stasis, agents should be introduced into the soil with a quantity of nutrient, e.g. the food base on which they have been produced. Adding more spores to the soil serves no purpose. The competitive saprophytic ability of the biological control agents determines whether it will grow and spread through the soil after its application, or whether it will disappear gradually. Specific conditions favour the chances of the agents. For example, soil sterilization and pasteurization are excellent ways of preparing a good niche as they kill the plant pathogens, creating a biological vacuum which is quickly filled with new pathogen invasions. Pre-emptive inoculation with antagonists may prevent the rapid reappearance of the pathogens (suppressiveness of pathogens). A widely used application of a biological control agent is root dipping of the nursery stock in a bacterial preparation of B. subtilis, which subsequently protects the plants against some soil pathogens. An effective method of protection against seedling diseases (e.g. damping-off) is to cover the seeds with antagonists. Some of the antagonists will even establish in the rhizosphere assuring much longer protection. Since seed-coat organisms are the first to profit from seed exudates, they have a lead in the competition with pathogens (e.g. with Trichoderma spp.). Current use of biological control of diseases in greenhouse crops Biological control of soil and airborne pathogens is of increasing interest and biological agents have become available in the last 10 years for use in greenhouse crops. Penicillium oxalicum reduces the incidence of F. oxysporum f. sp. Lycopersici, in both hydroponic and soil systems, and Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma koningii control Fusarium root and crown rot. Many of these biological control agents, however, are still being registered and are not yet commercially available in many countries. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 446 Future of biological control of plant pathogens Biological control of plant pathogens will probably become more widespread in the next few years. However, it is unlikely that biological control will be able to completely control plant diseases and therefore it is important to research the possibilities for integrating biological control with other control measures. Integrated production and protection (IPP) means integration of biological control with chemical control, but also with alternative control measures, such as application of plant extracts and use of good agricultural practices (GAP). In general, normal cultural practice aims primarily at optimum yields, using pesticides if necessary. With biological control of plant pathogens, cultural practices may need modifying to influence the susceptibility of the crop, as well as the environmental conditions of the pathogen and biological control agent. For example, the yield of greenhouse-grown cucumber is higher when relative humidity is higher; this is why growers use a climate control setting to increase humidity in the greenhouse, but it also creates conditions conducive to Botrytis infection. The success of biological control is determined by the balance between the biological control agent and the target organism. If conditions greatly favour the target organism, biological control may not be sufficient, but a minor adjustment to the conditions can make the difference.

If conditions greatly favour the target organism, biological control may not be sufficient, but a minor adjustment to the conditions can make the difference. Similarly, partially resistant cultivars used in combination with biological control offer better prospects than very susceptible cultivars. Other factors, such as the imbalances of the nutrient solution (excess of nitrogen or deficiency of calcium for example) may also influence a plant’s susceptibility to certain diseases and pests. Integration of biological controls and chemical control measures also offer potential as most biological control agents of plant diseases are not inhibited by insecticides. Some biological control agents are not affected by the fungicides used against their target pathogen or other pathogens; it is therefore possible to alternate the use of a biological control agent with a fungicide, depending on the circumstances. For example, if conditions favour the pathogen and not the biological control agent, a chemical is recommended; in other conditions, the biological control agent is recommended. For biological control agents incompatible with fungicides, it is possible to start with the biological control agent and only apply the chemical if disease gets out of control. Plate 14 Grey mould (Botrytis sp.) symptoms on a tomato stem 16. Integrated pest management 447 BIOLOGICAL NEMATODE, VIRUS AND WEED CONTROL Biological control of nematodes The development of nematodes can be inhibited in the soil: suppressive soils can have an antagonistic effect on plant pathogenic fungi, but they have also been discovered to contain a number of organisms with an antagonistic effect on nematodes. These organisms include nematophageous insects, predatory nematodes, fungi, protozoa and bacteria, but they are not yet available commercially for application in the biological control of nematodes. In order to stimulate the naturally occurring antagonists in the soil, detailed knowledge is needed of the soil’s ecosystem and other environmental factors, such as humidity and temperature; likewise, for applying suppressive soils to diseased soil. Acquiring this knowledge is not simple, for example, it is difficult to make a realistic estimate of the number of dead or inactive nematodes in the soil. To date, nematophageous fungi are the most promising agents. The nematicidal effects of the plant species Tagetes patula and T. erecta are well known. They secrete a product (an allelochemical) which suppresses populations of Pratylenchus, Tylenchorhyncus and Rotylenchus in roots and soils. In some countries, Tagetes spp. are used as catch crops; but they could be symptomless hosts of viruses (e.g. TYLCV, tomato yellow leaf curl virus) and therefore in warm regions their use is limited in greenhouse crops. Biological control of viruses There are two main approaches to biocontrol of virus diseases: biocontrol of vectors and biocontrol with attenuated strains. Vector biocontrol is essentially a form of biocontrol of insect pests and requires no further discussion. The use of attenuated strains is the only effective way of directly combating viruses (apart from the use of resistance). Mild strains of viruses produce hardly any symptoms, and should not reduce production. Tomato mosaic virus (TMV) and pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) are examples of production constraints which have been overcome (TMV) or reduced (PepMV) by applying mild strains to the host before natural infection by the wild virus strain occurs. The presence of the mild strain prevents multiplication of the virulent strain, and thus keeps the crop healthy. Protection by mild strains has led to a derived application (one of the best known examples of promising applications of biotechnology for increasing plant Plate 15 Symptoms of the virus pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) in tomato fruits GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 448 resistance): transferring the genes for the viral coat protein to susceptible hosts makes them resistant to the corresponding pathogen.

Biological control of weeds In protected crops, especially in closed cultivation systems, biological control of insects is possible by using their natural enemies. In the case of weed control, this solution is not practicable. Biological weed control has been successful with non- native plant species which enter the country and become an uncontrolled plague. Following introduction of natural enemies (mostly insects) from the country of origin, the population decreases to an acceptable level. This classic method of biological control of weeds is known as the inoculative method. Although not relevant to greenhouse crops, it is worth mentioning that biological control programmes of the invasive cactus species (Opuntia stricta and O. dilenii) have been implemented with great success during the last century in Australia (on 3 million ha) and South Africa (> 100 000 ha), using two exotic (from Latin America) phytophagous insects (the lepidopteran Cactoblastis cactorum and the mealy bug Dactylopius opuntiae). More recently (2012), FAO in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, introduced from South Africa the exotic species D. opuntiae (var. Stricta) for use in classical biological control of the invasive cactus O. stricta on over 50 000 ha of rangeland in southern Saudi Arabia. PHYSICAL CONTROL Control of pests and diseases by means of heat treatment or radiation is called physical control. Heat treatment is applied to control harmful organisms in soil and water; special equipment is sometimes used by growers to control weeds through flaming. Other methods are available to disinfect water. Production systems where there has been incidence of root and stem diseases should be rigorously sanitized. All production houses benefit from passive solarization during the non-cropping period in summer: structures are sealed completely after wetting surfaces; temperatures > 50 °C are needed to assist in the eradication or at least the reduction of pathogens and other pests in the production area. In order to start crops in soil free from pests and pathogens, chemical soil disinfection may be carried out – but cultural and physical methods, such as steam sterilization and solarization, should be adopted first when at all possible. 16. Integrated pest management 449 Sterilization of soil Heat treatment of the soil is known as soil sterilization but this is not strictly correct, as even the most effective treatment does not eliminate all living organisms and the soil is not actually sterile after treatment. Partial sterilization or pasteurization are more accurate terms and are achieved through steam sterilization or solarization. Solarization Solarization is easily combined with other control methods to reduce the need for chemical control. Together with reduced dosages of chemical fumigants, it allows better management of soil-borne pathogens, which are otherwise difficult to control. Solarization followed by use of biocontrol agents has good potential, facilitating the introduction of antagonists, especially in warm regions. Solarization is a form of soil pasteurization whereby solar energy is trapped beneath plastic sheets spread on the soil surface. It is a cheap and effective means of pasteurizing, and controls soil-borne pathogens, weeds and other pests. However, it is only effective when at least 30 days are available during a period of high solar radiation and can therefore only be applied in warmer climates, during the hot season, when no protected crop situation is present. The soil has to be wetted (water-holding capacity) to ensure that the absorbed energy goes beneath the top layer of the soil. A polyethylene cover prevents transpiration and escape of the heat into the air. Transparent plastic is more efficient at raising the temperature in the soil because of the greenhouse effect it provokes. The greenhouse effect is absent with opaque and black plastic The depth of heat penetration (and hence the efficacy) is improved by prolonging the period of solarization. The temperature increase is about 10 °C in the topsoil and decreases with depth. To control weeds effectively, a solarization period of 4–6 weeks (depending on radiation) is necessary.

Annual weeds, especially Gramineae and parasitic weeds, seem to respond to this treatment; with perennial weed species, the results are not as good. Soil solarization is a promising technique and may have an important future in many countries (especially with the phasing out of methyl bromide under the Montreal Protocol). Initially used only in hot regions during the summer, solarization is spreading to cooler areas and cooler seasons thanks to technological advances. Soil solarization controls numerous pathogens, including Colletotrichum coccodes, F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, V. dahliae, P. lycopersici and Plate 16 Application of soil solarization (soil disinfection from nematodes, pathogens, insects and weeds) during summer time, in tunnel greenhouses in the Jordan Valley GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 450 R. solani. Solarization also decreases the population of Meloidogyne spp., as well as many greenhouse crop insects which pupate in the soil (Liriomyza spp., Tuta absoluta, Frankliniella occidentalis etc.) in greenhouse crops. When used adequately, soil solarization decreases significantly the use of fumigants. Solarization of tomato stakes and hooks is a successful control method of some diseases such as Didymella stem canker, and could easily be achieved by storing this agricultural material in empty plastic greenhouses during the hot months of the year. In warmer areas, a significant kill of pathogens and insect and mite pests could be achieved simply by closing the greenhouse in the off-season (space solarization). Solarization of container media, such as peat, offers potential as it makes these products recyclable. Unfortunately, only a limited number of countries, especially in warm regions, really take full advantage of this freely available natural control technique. Agronomic benefits of soil solarization In addition to eliminating certain pests, solarization also increases yields. Improvement in plant growth has been observed in solar-heated soils even when non-infested. One explanation for the increased growth is that upon soil sterilization (partial or complete), minerals are released and the nutritional status of the soil improves. Chemical and physical analyses of solar-heated soils confirm the presence of increased amounts of NO3-, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and soluble organic matter. Another explanation for the increase in plant growth after solarization is the stimulation of beneficial micro-organisms: many saprophytes (notably heat- tolerant ones) survive better during solarization than most pathogens. Steam treatment Soil disinfestation using steam has been used by greenhouse growers for almost a century. Plant pathogens are eliminated by steaming and even seeds of weeds are annihilated (however, high expense means that it cannot be applied solely for weed control). Steaming the soil before planting also stimulates crop growth. Heat treatment of the soil at 100 °C is the most effective method of soil sterilization. Bacterial and fungal pathogens, nematodes and even soil-borne viruses are killed at this temperature. A temperature of 70 °C maintained for half an hour, on the other hand, is sufficient for the control of fungal pathogens, bacterial pathogens and nematodes. Methods for soil steam treatment are: sheet steaming, drain steam system and negative pressure steaming. Sheet steaming Steam is blown under a sheet covering the soil and is left to penetrate the soil. The rate of success depends on the type, cultivation and moisture of the soil. To facilitate penetration, the soil should be dry and cultivated as deeply as possible before introducing the steam. This method works well in clay soils, but in sand 16. Integrated pest management 451 and loam soils the required temperature of 70 °C is reached only in the upper soil layers, and pathogens are able to survive in the deeper layers. Disinfestation of peat soils is generally very difficult owing to their water-retaining capacity. Drain steam system To improve the temperature range at greater depths, a new system was developed – drain pipes buried at a depth of 50–60 cm and 80 cm apart, through which the steam is blown. This system is permanent and expensive and, therefore, not widely adopted. Negative pressure steaming Negative pressure steaming is a new method: steam is introduced under the steaming sheet covering the soil, and pulled into the soil by negative pressure achieved by sucking air from the soil through buried", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Negative pressure steaming Negative pressure steaming is a new method: steam is introduced under the steaming sheet covering the soil, and pulled into the soil by negative pressure achieved by sucking air from the soil through buried perforated polypropene pipes by means of a fan. Negative pressure steaming is an important improvement on the traditional methods. It gives a similar or better temperature range compared with sheet steaming; it saves fuel and has lower investments compared with drain steaming. It can thus be concluded that the most efficient steam system for all types of soil is negative pressure steaming. For sustainable agriculture, steam sterilization of soil is preferable to disinfection by chemicals. Disinfection methods for water The development from soil to soilless cultures has not resulted in the disappearance of soil-borne diseases. Most root-infecting pathogens are also found in new cultivation systems. In a closed growing system involving recirculation of drain water, the risk of spreading root-infecting pathogens always exists. To minimize the spread of diseases, the drain water must run from the growing medium into the holding tank, where it is disinfected before reuse. Both surface and rainwater reservoirs may be contaminated with plant pathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses; therefore, initially the whole water supply must be disinfected. Heat treatment Heat treatment gives effective control of fungal, bacterial and virus diseases. A temperature of 90 °C for 30 seconds is recommended. Heat exchangers provide efficient use of energy. Oxidation Oxidation by means of ozone or ultraviolet (UV) radiation are excellent methods for disinfesting water. Ozone is the most powerful oxidizing agent, inactivating human pathogenic viruses and bacteria. It is used to disinfect drinking water and industrial and municipal waste water; it reacts rapidly and has no residual power. As a donor of electrons (oxidation) to other substances, ozone itself is reduced to oxygen and may eliminate also fungi, bacteria and viruses. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 452 Ultraviolet radiation, especially UV-rays with a short wavelength range of 200 to 280 nm, destroys micro-organisms by photochemical reaction. Water filtration Water filtration is used for selective disinfestation against Phytophthora spp. It has been used to purify drinking water for over a century. In tests for its efficacy against plant-pathogenic fungi, it proved unreliable against Fusarium oxysporum as the microconidia easily passed through the filter. Changing the flow rate or using different material could improve the efficacy. Different ultrafiltration membranes with a pore size of 0.001 µm have been tested for total water disinfestation but, for various technical reasons, including blocking of the membrane, the method is not suited to greenhouses. Microfiltration membranes with a pore size of 0.5 µm could be used for selective disinfestation, preventing the spread of fungal spores and nematodes; however the same problems arise as with ultrafilters. MECHANICAL CONTROL Mechanical control of insect pests includes the use of exclusion insect nets, colour sticky bands and pheromone-baited water traps. Mechanical control concerns also weeds and diseases. Using insect screens for mechanical exclusion of insect pests and vectors Insects may enter the greenhouse from outside through the ventilation openings. Installation of screens on the ventilation openings will prevent or reduce the entry of pests. Screens with a mesh size of 0.15 mm exclude thrips; 0.35 mm keeps out whitefly and aphids; 0.8 mm is sufficient for leafminers. Screens do not suppress or eradicate pests, they merely exclude most of them; therefore, they must be installed prior to pest appearance, and supplementary pest control measures, such as intelligent chemical control and biocontrol, are required. Insect parasitoids and predators smaller than their prey can still immigrate through screens into the greenhouse; larger ones, unfortunately, cannot. In the Mediterranean region, protecting crops from arthropods is considered more important than protecting them from the weather, so the physical exclusion of insects from the greenhouse should help reduce incidence of direct crop damage and insect-transmitted virus diseases. Theoretically, this exclusion can be achieved by fitting fabric screens with a mesh aperture smaller than the insect’s body width over side and roof ventilation openings and doorways; in reality, some insect penetration persists.

It should be noted, however, that the use of screens might impede ventilation, resulting in overheating and increased humidity which promote plant stress and susceptibility to pests and diseases. Increased humidity necessitates more frequent 16. Integrated pest management 453 fungicide sprays than previously required in an unscreened greenhouse. Moreover, screens reduce light transmission; it is, therefore, necessary to make compromises in light, temperature and humidity management in order to avoid adverse effects on crops and their susceptibility to diseases. To minimize these harmful effects, it is possible to use forced ventilation, but this only helps to pull small insects through the screen. Thus, while screens can reduce immigrant populations of pests, they also reduce the immigration of beneficial arthropods. In neither case is exclusion total. The unfortunate fact is that the use of fine mesh screens when coupled with dusty conditions prevalent in warm regions seriously impedes greenhouse ventilation. Types of screens Various types of screen have been developed to protect crops from insects; the challenge for the grower is to match the type of screen to the local conditions (climate and insect populations). Woven screens Conventional woven screens are made from plain woven plastic. In commercial screens the slot is rectangular with a width smaller than the whitefly’s body size – about 0.2 mm – but it must allow maximum air and light transmission. Screens designed to exclude Bemisia tabaci still permit a certain level of penetration, and they fail to exclude Frankliniella occidentalis. They do, however, exclude most larger insects, such as moths, beetles, leafminers, aphids and leafhoppers, and they retain bee pollinators inside the greenhouse. Unwoven screens These are made of porous, unwoven polyester and polypropylene or of clear, microperforated, polyethylene fabric. All are very light materials which can be applied loosely and directly over transplants or seeded soil, without need for mechanical support. They have been used primarily in the open field as floating covers in early spring, to enhance earliness and to protect against early virus infection. Plate 17 Application of 50-mesh insect screen to greenhouse side ventilation as a mechanical barrier preventing the immigration of flying insect pests (leafminers, whiteflies, aphids, thrips, lepidopteran pests such us Tuta absoluta, Chrysodeixis chalcites, Spodoptera sp. Helicoverpa sp. etc.) into the greenhouse crop Plate 18 Dust accumulation on insect screens could impede greenhouse ventilation if not washed regularly Note: Insect screens are a strong line of defence in an IPM programme when applied properly to all ventilation openings of the greenhouse. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 454 UV-absorbing screens These are claimed to protect crops from insect pests and from virus diseases vectored by insects, by modifying insect behaviour. Unfortunately, these effects are also extended to pollinators and natural enemies. Whitefly exclusion Whitefly-proof (50-mesh) woven screens are by far the most efficient mechanical barrier. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a small insect, about 0.2 mm wide, which transmits TYLCV (tomato yellow leaf curl virus) and has become the limiting factor in vegetable production in the Mediterranean region and the Near East. Its physical exclusion from greenhouses is crucial and, accordingly, whitefly- proof screens were developed. While the rate of whitefly exclusion is generally proportional to the screen’s mesh, the insect’s ability to pass through any barrier cannot be predicted solely on the basis of thoracic width and mesh size. There is an unexpectedly high rate of whitefly penetration due to the great variability in screen samples resulting from uneven and slipping weave.

An airlock SAS entrance into the nursery or greenhouse production area prevents the easy entry of insects into the main plant- growing areas. The SAS could also be fitted with traps and sticky yellow bands along both sides. Mass trapping of insects Colour sticky bands Specific colours attract certain day-flying insects. For example, yellow sticky bands attract many insects and are often used to capture winged aphids, leafminers and adult whiteflies. Blue sticky bands are especially attractive to thrips. Yellow and blue cards or bands coated with adhesives are, therefore, used to attract and capture small flying insects in greenhouses. For the purpose of mass trapping, sticky bands 10–40 cm wide are used for greenhouse crops (about 100 m/ ha). The bands are installed at a height of about 1 m between greenhouse pools, 2 weeks prior to transplanting; they must be maintained throughout the crop cycle. Yellow sticky bands are widely used in greenhouse crops. However, mass trapping is not recommended in greenhouses where Plate 19 Yellow sticky bands for mass trapping (kill) of small flying insect pests (leafminers, whiteflies, aphids, thrips etc.) 16. Integrated pest management 455 natural enemies are released for biological control as many flying beneficial insects will be attracted and killed by yellow sticky bands. Pheromone-baited traps Pheromone water traps are used successfully for the mass trapping of the new invasive species of lepidopteran, Tuta absoluta, in tomato greenhouses in the Mediterranean region and the Near East (2006–12). Since pheromone traps are so effective for catching male insects, numerous traps (over 10 per ha) placed throughout a greenhouse can sometimes remove sufficient insects to substantially reduce the local population and limit the ensuing damage. Nevertheless, the greenhouse must be fully equipped with insect screens to avoid attracting any additional males of T. absoluta from the environment outside the greenhouse. Mechanical control of diseases Many viruses and airborne fungi and bacteria spread within a crop from one or several sources, including crop plants, but also weeds occurring within or around a crop. By eliminating the source, an epidemic may be avoided. However, elimination of plants in the area surrounding a greenhouse is not simple when commercial crops are grown adjacent to private gardens, abandoned or desolated crop fields, or when virus reservoirs occur in the natural environment. Removal (rouging) of infected plants in a crop is effective, particularly in young crops where a small number of plants form foci of infection for secondary spread. Any disease Plate 21 Large numbers of small flying insects are attracted and killed by yellow sticky bands Note: Yellow sticky bands for mass trapping are not compatible with inoculative or inundative biological control as they attract and kill the released predators and parasitoids. Plate 20 Numerous adult whiteflies attracted and killed by yellow sticky bands (other non-relevant small flying insects are also attracted and killed) Plate 22 Light water traps baited with two pheromone lures for the mass trapping of adult males of Tuta absoluta in greenhouse tomato Note: In case the traps are used in a greenhouse, the latter should be equipped with insect nets to prevent any attraction/migration of the pest T. absoluta from outside greenhouse surroundings into the crop. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 456 development in the vicinity of the removed plant must be followed up. Rouging is particularly effective for viruses transmitted mechanically (e.g. pepino mosaic virus) or by vectors (e.g. TYLCV). Dead leaves and flowers on a crop plant should be removed before they become a massive saprophytic base for inoculum. Pruning should always be done with a sharp knife, leaving no snags. Disease can often be avoided simply by reducing damage to roots, stems and foliage during cultural operations. Plants surviving from a previous crop (volunteers) form another potential reservoir of infection within a new crop.

Flaming is done directly or indirectly, using equipment which produces infrared radiation. For application between crop rows, special protecting shields are required. Annual weeds only are killed; grasses have good tolerance and repeated treatments are necessary. Costs are high. Black and white plastic mulch applied locally (on rows) or covering the total greenhouse ground is, nowadays, an important way of controlling weeds inside the greenhouse. Depending on the region and the season, total ground coverage may impact climatic conditions inside the greenhouse. MONITORING Monitoring involves systematically checking the greenhouse crop at regular intervals and critical times to gather information not only about the crop, pests and their natural enemies but also about diseases Plate 23 Foci of viral infection with TYLCV Note: Infected plants should be removed as soon as symptoms appear to prevent whiteflies from visiting them and spreading more virus to the healthy plants. Plate 24 Whiteflies on the underside of a weed (Malva sp.) Note: Failure to remove weeds from a greenhouse especially before planting the crop will allow the whiteflies to move from these weed sources to the new planted crop. 16. Integrated pest management 457 and their antagonists. Visual observation of symptoms, laboratory analyses of soils or plant parts, weather data, sticky colour traps and pheromone traps can all be used to collect the maximum information necessary for an informed decision. The more often a crop is monitored, the more information a grower has about what is happening in the greenhouse. Insect monitoring using colour sticky traps For flying insects, yellow and blue sticky cards of various dimensions are recommended to monitor the population in greenhouses where biological control is and is not applied. A minimum of eight sticky cards (8 × 20 cm) per ha should be distributed to cover the various climate zones in the greenhouse (especially in non-climate-controlled greenhouses). While coloured sticky bands are set at a fixed height and must be maintained throughout the crop cycle, sticky traps need monitoring and changing every week and their height must be adjusted to the top of the plant canopy. Sticky colour traps are undoubtedly excellent monitoring tools of small flying insect pests, but require a minimum of expertise for the recognition of captured insects species. Insect monitoring using pheromone traps Attractant-baited traps may be adopted for two major reasons. First, they are very sensitive and can capture pest insects present in densities too low to detect using other inspection methods. Second, traps baited with chemical attractants capture only one species or a narrow range of species, simplifying the identification and counting of target pests. This sensitivity and specificity make attractant-baited traps efficient, labour-saving tools compared with colour traps which are non- specific and require a specialist to carry out the monitoring. Attractant-baited traps are used in monitoring programmes to: • detect the presence of an insect pest; • estimate the relative density of a pest population in a given greenhouse; • indicate the first emergence or peak flight activity of a pest species, time an insecticide application or a biological control release, or signal the need for additional scouting; and • carry out mass trapping of male adults. Plate 25 The height of yellow sticky cards for monitoring of small flying insects (leafminers, whiteflies, aphids, thrips etc.) has to be adjusted as plants grow to obtain an accurate population estimate of these pests GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 458 The most common use of chemical attractants is in traps to monitor insect populations; although not all compounds used are pheromones, many publications refer to all attractant-baited traps as pheromone traps.

Traps for some pests are coated with an adhesive that also contains the chemical attractant. Pheromones are difficult to apply in greenhouses: air currents in protected crops are different from those in the field, and as a result, male lepidopteran attraction to the traps could be negatively affected by active ventilation. CHEMICAL CONTROL Chemical control entails the application of botanical or synthetic, organic or inorganic compounds that have a killing, inhibiting or repulsive effect on organisms which are threatening to humans, animals and plants. Following years of application, the disadvantages of uncontrolled use of chemicals became apparent. A conflict developed between the social values of the public and the economic values of the chemical industry and agribusiness. There was a move towards alternative application methods and control strategies, and stricter demands were put in place for the approval of new chemical products. Nevertheless, chemical control continues to play an important role in the control of pests and diseases in greenhouse crops. To combat the relatively small number of species of pests, diseases and weeds, a variety of chemical ingredients are used in a wide array of formulations. Pesticides are among the most effective instruments in crop protection: if used correctly they have a rapid and largely complete effect; they are applicable against nearly all pests and may be used even at a late stage of development with many pest populations. Chemicals are important in protected cultivation – even more important than in other cultivation methods given the high value of the crops grown (in particular ornamental crops). The zero-tolerance of pests in the export of ornamentals and the non-acceptance of cosmetic damage in certain crops contribute to a higher Plate 26 Pheromone lure on a sticky paper card attracts specifically males of T. absoluta and allows the detection of the pest even when populations are still very low Note: Pheromone traps are easy and reliable tools for the monitoring of certain lepidopteran pests in greenhouse crops. 16. Integrated pest management 459 usage of chemicals in protected crops. Given the high value of protected crops, expensive chemicals and costly methods of application (such as soil drenching) may still be economically justified in order to achieve the required high standards of pest and disease control. Moreover, greenhouse cultivation changes the circumstances under which crops are grown more than any other type of cultivation – the enclosed environment and intensive monoculture encourage the development of pests and diseases, making chemical control necessary. Application of pesticides Pesticides can be applied as a preventive treatment to protect crops, or as a curative treatment to destroy or limit population development of noxious organisms. Uptake and transport of the chemical through the plant is a systemic mode of action, where the protective effect is felt also by plant parts which do not receive direct treatment. In the case of fungicides, systemic chemicals can reach the already-existing infections in the plant and eliminate them, providing curative protection. Non-systemic fungicides (so-called contact pesticides) only have a superficial effect, and their role is mostly preventive. Pesticides can be applied to the leaf, stem, root or seed-coat. Most products, however, have been developed for application on aerial plant parts. Special pesticide formulations have been developed for the various application methods. When selecting the appropriate application technique for a certain pest or disease, a range of considerations are necessary: • product to be used • equipment available • type, stage, location and spread of the target organism • kind of crop and its stage of development • susceptibility of the crop, or pest or disease to the product • weather conditions • cost The application of sprays, dusts and mists is labour-intensive, but they also leave a residue on the plant that continues to kill after application.

As greenhouses are enclosed, it is also possible to use smokes, fogs and aerosols. These methods propel fine droplets or particles of the pesticide into the air, so that insects and other organisms within the crop are also reached. Greenhouse application can be through a crop treatment or a space treatment; products can be applied in dry or liquid form. Dry products Dry chemical products can be applied in dust form or as granules; they have the advantage that they can be used in situations where water is a limiting factor. In GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 460 some countries, dustable powders can only be used in greenhouses, as the product may be sensitive to wind and thermal changes; however, dusting is not a common method of pest control, due to the visible residue on the plants. Granules are added to the soil just before or during sowing, and mixed with it afterwards; the active ingredient dissolves into the soil moisture. These products can provide control of insects and nematodes. Similar to granules is the fast developing technology of seed-coating. Seeds are intensively mixed with a powder or a liquid to which the pesticide has been added. If a sticky additive is included, less pesticide is required, and a pigment is also usually added to distinguish treated seeds. The result is a smooth, solid, soluble coating around the seed which can protect the young seedling in the soil against, for example, insects and fungi. Liquid products Liquid chemical products can, if required, be diluted with water, and a variety of apparatus exist for their application. Penetration through the crop and product coverage on the plant and the crop must be taken into account when determining the amount of spray solution required and the droplet size. Depending on the type of product, 100 percent coverage is not always necessary: a systemic pesticide does not need to cover the complete crop, but complete coverage is necessary when a contact pesticide (most oils and solvents) is used to kill a relatively immobile insect. To achieve a satisfactory degree of coverage, the distribution of the droplets, i.e. the droplet size, is very important, while the amount of sprayed liquid is less relevant. With low volume techniques, both crop-oriented and space treatments can be given in the greenhouse. Space treatment is the application of a pesticide through the air so that it spreads homogeneously in space and falls very slowly onto the crop. Advantages of space treatment are that less time is required and the crop stays dry (but not all agents can be applied in this way). On the other hand, the crop effect tends to be weak, which means that mainly flying insects are reached. If used against fungi, this method only works preventively and when there is little damage. To improve the efficacy of this technique, ventilation openings should be closed, but the temperature and RH (relative humidity) should not be allowed to rise too high to avoid damage to the crop (the RH cannot be too low either). The condensation water inside the greenhouse will contain chemical residues and should be collected.

Guided or supervised control While IPM involves several alternative control methods, guided control only deals with chemical control. Guided control aims to reduce pesticide use by determining whether a control for a certain pest is necessary and, if so, when it should be applied (for optimum effect). In guided control, chemical control is only deemed necessary when the economic benefits counterbalance the costs; it implies use of curative rather than preventive pesticides. In both IPM and guided control, complete eradication of the pest or disease should not be pursued: it may not be required to minimize the loss, it might be economically or technically impossible, and it could be undesirable because of unacceptable side-effects. The rules of guided control are also adopted in integrated control, but not the other way round: what is important in IPM is not necessarily important in guided control. In order to decide whether to spray or not, a grower needs to be able to recognize the pest insects and diseases of his crop. During the growing season, the crop must be observed and noxious organisms monitored: the level of infestation is extrapolated to the end of the season, when the harvest takes place and the yield loss is known. Forecasting the expected damage and loss is not always accepted practice – it is preferable to “play safe”, especially when dealing with high-value crops, and growers do not usually follow the guided control principles. When monitoring a noxious organism, it is necessary not only to count the numbers, but also to observe the stage of development of both crop and pest. For example, the caterpillar stage of a pest insect can be dangerous for the crop, and the adult stage not. Moreover, one development phase may be easily controlled, while another poses more problems. The damage threshold level is not a constant factor throughout the growing season, as the damage caused by the pest or disease also depends on the crop stage. For example, a pest can cause enormous damage and yield loss during germination, while a later infestation will give no reduction in yield at all. Tomato leafminers (e.g. Liriomyza spp. and Tuta absoluta) are more injurious to the tomato crop in its early stage of development than when the plant canopy is fully developed. Therefore, and contrary to common belief, pest thresholds are dynamic and should be linked to the plant growth stage. The damage threshold may also be influenced by the environmental conditions. Moreover, if a single spraying can reduce several pest populations at the same time, it could be decided to apply controls at a lower damage threshold level than for only one pest population. The damage threshold is lower, because combined control makes the intervention cheaper: the balance between control costs and loss through damage is reached at a lower damage level, i.e. a smaller pest population. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 462 Guided control requires technical expertise and is not yet implemented everywhere. Calendar spraying continues to be widely used for a variety of reasons: • Growers may lack the necessary information about the damage threshold of the noxious organism. • Growers do not always have the relative knowledge about pest organisms and the mode of action of the chemical product. • Proper observation and sampling techniques are not always available, especially for fungi. • Observation time is viewed as an extra labour cost (even though the total costs will in reality be reduced). • In some cases (e.g. with ornamentals, especially pot plants), damage thresholds are very low (but not always zero), which encourages growers to spray for completely “clean” products. Side-effects on beneficial organisms Pesticides can exhibit primary or secondary effects on bees, predators, parasitoids and pathogens of target pests. Primary effects are direct or indirect, depending on their exposure and on the biological parameter influenced. Direct mortality of beneficial organisms may be caused by the following: • direct contact during application • pesticide residues • taking up contaminated prey • intoxication by fumigants • contact or contamination with soil disinfectants Secondary effects include the following: • killing the prey/host of a beneficial organism • killing species which produce alternative food", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Generally, herbicides, acaricides and fungicides have less effect than insecticides, although mycopesticides are highly susceptible to fungicides. 16. Integrated pest management 463 Effects on predators Most pyrethroids and carbamates are harmful to predatory mites. Aphidoletes aphidimyza is susceptible to insecticide and acaricide treatments, and is also affected by organophosphates. Coccinellids have a high mortality rate as a result of nearly all compound groups, except micro-organisms and soap. Chrysopids are not harmed by acaricides, most pyrethroids, soap or micro-organisms, but they are affected by the majority of insect growth regulators (IGRs) and organophosphate. Predatory bugs are harmed by pyrethroids, carbamates, most organophosphates and some IGRs. Fungicides and herbicides are relatively harmless for coccinellids, chrysopids and predatory bugs, but partly harmful to predatory mites. Effects on parasitoids Synthetic pyrethroids and pyrethrin are very harmful to adults, regardless of the species. Organophosphates are very harmful to unprotected stages and, with a few exceptions, also to the protected life stages of the parasitoid. IGRs and most of the acaricides are harmless to both the susceptible and the protected developmental stage of the parasitoids. Plant extracts (except pyrethrin and neem extracts), soap and micro-organisms are harmless. Fungicides are generally harmful to adult parasitoids. Very few herbicides are harmful to adult wasps, but not to wasps in other developmental stages. Pesticide resistance Pests and pathogens can overcome the toxic effects of pesticides by metabolizing the active ingredient into less toxic components and reducing the absorption of the chemical (physiological resistance) or by avoiding exposure (behavioural resistance). No doubt, pest and disease resistance development will continue to be the biggest challenge to chemical control. In greenhouses, pesticide-resistant strains of fungi and pests appear frequently. This phenomenon occurs because the greenhouse is a closed system in which the population of selected strains is not diluted by the outdoor wild population. Moreover, the optimal conditions for their development prevail for long periods in greenhouses, and the number of generations, therefore, increases; to maintain control, frequent pesticide applications are necessary. As a result, selection pressure towards resistance to pesticides in greenhouse crops is signifiantly higher than in open field crops. Fungicide resistance The main pathogens known to develop resistance to fungicides in greenhouses are Botrytis cinerea (grey mould), Pseudoperonospora cubensis (downy mildew of cucurbits), Didymelia bryoniae (gummy stem blight of cucurbits) and Sphaerotheca fusca (powdery mildew of cucurbits). GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 464 The benzimidazole fungicides (benomyl, carbendazim, thiophanates) have high resistance potential against pathogens because they have a specific mode of action. Resistance is not usually associated with a significant loss of fitness of the pathogen. It occurs in populations of B. cinerea, D. bryoniae, Fusarium and powdery mildews. Mixtures and alternations with multi-site contact fungicides may delay this selection before resistance becomes widespread. Acute problems of resistance to dicarboximide fungicides (e.g. iprodione, procymidone, vinclozolin) arise when fungicides are used intensively and exclusively over many seasons. Isolates are moderately resistant and tend to be almost as fit as sensitive strains in the absence of fungicides. It is recommended to restrict the number of dicarboximide treatments to no more than three per crop in greenhouses, whether resistance exists or not. When infection pressure is high, it is usually recommended to alternate or mix these fungicides with protectants, such as chlorothalonil or captan, or with biocontrol, where there is usually no selection for resistance. Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors (EBIs) are a group of fungicides, including triazole, imidazole and pyrimidine. In contrast to the strong sharp resistance towards benzimidazoles and dicarboximides, resistance towards EBIs develops in the form of slow shifts in the pathogen population.

Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors (EBIs) are a group of fungicides, including triazole, imidazole and pyrimidine. In contrast to the strong sharp resistance towards benzimidazoles and dicarboximides, resistance towards EBIs develops in the form of slow shifts in the pathogen population. For example, powdery mildews in greenhouses were controlled for several years by benzimidazoles, hydroxypyrimidines, pyrazophos and EBIs. There is resistance in populations of S. Fusca, but the alternation of fungicides practised in many countries is helping to solve the problem. It is generally recommended to rotate or mix EBI fungicides with fungicides from other groups as well as with biocontrol. The failure of disease control in greenhouses is exemplified by the history of grey mould epidemics. Multiple resistant isolates occur in greenhouses with resistance towards benzimidazole, diethofencarb, dicarboximides and ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, and even extreme summer conditions do not prevent the survival of fungicide-resistant isolates. Phenylamide fungicides that inhibit RNA (ribonucleic acid) synthesis were introduced in the late 1970s for Phycomycetes control, at a time when P. cubensis was controlled mainly with protective applications of dithiocarbamates and chlorothalonil. In the early 1980s, phenylamide metalaxyl was released and soon afterwards resistant strains were selected. Metalaxyl-resistant strains seem to be more competitive than wild-type strains. Resistance was found also in Phytophthora infestans on tomato. Anti-resistance mixtures of metalaxyl with protectant fungicides were developed to cope with phenilamide resistance. Insecticide and acaricide resistance Insecticide and acaricide resistance of nearly all important arthropod greenhouse pests is well documented. Besides genetic and operational factors influencing the selection of resistant individuals, biotic reasons (e.g. generation turnover, number 16. Integrated pest management 465 of offspring per generation and type of reproduction) have a major impact on resistance development. Most of the pest species in greenhouse crops are prone to resistance selection with regard to these biological parameters. Bemisia tabaci has recently developed resistance against a range of conventional insecticides (neocotinoids and pyrethroids) as well as against IGRs and juvenile hormone analogues (Pyriproxyfen and Buprofezine). Myzus persicae and Aphis gossypii have developed resistance to the most commonly used synthetic pyrethroids in greenhouse crops, while Frankliniella occidentalis has developed resistance against most pesticide groups, resulting in severe economic losses in the affected crops. Resistance management In order to reduce the pressure on the development of resistance in pathogen populations, it is usually better to limit a pathogen’s exposure to a group of fungicides. The number of applications of fungicides with the same mode of action must be limited, especially when fungi have many cycles during the growing season. Moreover, the application of non-chemical methods is also recommended. Insecticide resistance management strategies for pests comprise different approaches classified as: management by moderation (low dosages, reduced number of applications), and management by multiple attack (application of mixtures). For IPM programmes, non-target effects on natural enemies have to be considered. Attempts have been made to improve the compatibility of beneficial organisms with pesticide application by selecting beneficials with resistance to chemical pesticides, but this is often a cumbersome procedure as the pesticides used may change often. The degree of resistance, stability and possible influence on the fitness of the tolerant organisms must all be assessed before the selected organisms can be used in pest or disease control. In addition to its compatibility with other control methods, resistance management is another important aspect of chemical control in IPM. Resistance management involves various strategies for minimizing the risk of development of resistance to pesticides in the target pest. For situations of reliance on chemical control, several strategies of resistance management have been developed, categorized as follows: • Moderation refers to the application of pesticides at lower rates, lower frequencies and less thoroughly, and aims at delaying or forestalling resistance by allowing a portion of the susceptible individuals to survive. • Saturation aims to prevent the evolution of resistance by rendering resistance genes functionally recessive, through exposure to dosages that are lethal to GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 466 heterozygous-resistant individuals. This can be accomplished in certain cases without increasing the dosage rate of insecticides per unit area, for example, through addition of an attractant to the insecticide (e.g. pheromones). •", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

This strategy requires the availability of pairs of pesticides with non-overlapping, cross-resistance spectra. It takes advantage of the initially rare frequency of genes for resistance to new types of pesticides, possible interactive effects between pesticides (synergism, negative cross-resistance), and low fitness in resistant phenotypes. PRACTICAL RATIONAL CHEMICAL CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE PESTS AND DISEASES A range of tactics and schemes are available for the management of insects and diseases, including prevention and sanitation (discussed above). The use of pesticides will remain, at least in the short to medium term, an important strategy, allowing the grower to continue to produce economically a quality crop. It is essential that the use of chemicals in IPM be based on informed decisions (ET – economic threshold) and only after considering the impact of the factors regulating the populations of pests and pathogens, making sure that there are no other effective management tools. Even though a degree of chemical control might still be necessary, pesticide use and associated risks must be observed. In this case, IPM is foreseen as a way to keep pesticide applications to the minimum required and at the lowest effective dose with the most selective products, while observing the necessary safety intervals before harvest. Five major steps are recommended when using pesticides to maximize the success of the operation; they are outlined below. Step 1: Proper identification and risk assessment of the pest’s and disease’s life stage The first most crucial step is correct identification of the pest or disease causing the problem. Proper identification is mandatory and false identification leads to possible misunderstanding of the pest’s or disease’s behaviour and of the potential dangers. Correct identification allows the grower to understand the pest or disease, seek out additional specific information about potential dangers to the crop, and know how to best manage it. Populations of pests and diseases must be monitored regularly following scientifically established methods appropriate to the region or locality. Existing and validated forecasting models for diseases should be implemented and adequate insect monitoring tools should be used depending on availability. Proper identification and risk assessment is the first and primary step in managing pests and diseases. Solving Step 1 leads to Step 2. 16. Integrated pest management 467 Step 2: Choosing the proper pesticide Only after the grower has properly identified the pest or disease can the best pesticide be selected. Pesticides are sometimes effective against one pest or disease but useless against other closely related ones. Also, one pesticide may be effective against a specific developmental stage while another may be effective against a different or perhaps all developmental stages. Correctly identifying the pest or disease and understanding its biology and life cycle allows the grower to choose the best pesticide. Growers should consult extension agents or pesticide companies and dealers for more advice. Step 3: Proper usage of pesticides After selecting the pesticide, growers must decide on the amount to use. The information is contained on the label, but more than one option is usually given. To make the correct choice, as much knowledge as possible about the biology of the pest or disease must be gathered. Factors, such as pest size and population, play an important role in insect management. For example, small worms may require the lowest recommended label rate while large worms may require the highest label rate; however, continuous use of the higher rate can lead to insect resistance. Once a pest or pathogen population becomes resistant, it is difficult for any amount of that pesticide to control it. Continuous overdosing with one pesticide can cause resistance to develop not only to the pesticide applied, but perhaps to other pesticides as well. Workers must have the proper measuring devices to make sure that the correct amounts of insecticide are used.

Continuous overdosing with one pesticide can cause resistance to develop not only to the pesticide applied, but perhaps to other pesticides as well. Workers must have the proper measuring devices to make sure that the correct amounts of insecticide are used. Greenhouse growers frequently have smaller areas to spray than growers in the field and therefore need smaller amounts of pesticides. For example, a field tomato farmer may use 1 000 cc/ha of a material in 500 litres of water; this is an easy quantity to measure. However, in a greenhouse, only 20 litres of spray may be needed to do the greenhouse block; this means that very small amounts (even less than 1 teaspoon) must be measured, but a spoon is a non-graduated container and is a very poor, inaccurate and dangerous way to measure pesticides. Growers should therefore buy a set of graduated cylinders marked in millilitres and a set of good quality measuring cups. Glass can be used, but plastic is often preferred to avoid breakage. Measuring devices, such as graduated cylinders, have pouring lips and graduated measuring markings that allow for accurate measurement and preparation of spray in quantities from 1 to 500 litres or more. Measuring devices can guarantee accurate measurement, thus allowing for effective kill, a safe range of pesticide residues on the crop, more efficient use of chemicals and money, and the reduction or elimination of phytotoxicity. Proper measuring devices also play an important role in the overall safety and handling of pesticides: they help prevent spillage of concentrated materials. Pesticide concentrates are usually handled when the sprayer is loaded and dilute sprays are being prepared, and special handling precautions are necessary at this time. The applicator must GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 468 be particularly careful when handling finished sprays but even more so when dealing with concentrated material. Workers must be mindful, cautious and use all pesticides according to the label. If excessive quantities of pesticide are used, the following problems can arise: • The crop can have more residue than the law allows, posing health hazards to consumers and potentially preventing the crop from entering the market. • The crop can be confiscated by authorities for excessive residues and destroyed without any compensation to the grower. • Resulting publicity can harm future markets for that commodity. • Re-entry by workers into overdosed areas is potentially dangerous and can lead to illness, medical costs and liability to the grower. • Overdoses can speed up the pest’s or pathogen’s resistance process. • Production costs increase without the benefit of added profits. • Phytotoxicity is more likely to occur. It is important not to exceed the label rates. If the maximum labelled rate does not achieve the desired results, other reasons for failure must be sought. It is unlikely that additional amounts of the same material will improve the situation. The old cliché – “If a little is good, a lot is better” – can have disastrous results. Step 4: Proper timing The chosen pesticide should be applied at the correct time and this is not an easy task. Determining the best time to apply chemical control is a dynamic and comprehensive process, and failure to treat at or near the correct time is one of the major reasons for unsuccessful pest and disease management. Despite the difficulties involved, steps may be taken to help make a reasonable decision: • Regularly and thoroughly inspect the crop, noting the presence of pests and diseases and any increase in incidence. • Know the pest or disease, its behaviour, and its ability to damage the crop. • Be aware of economic thresholds if available. • Know the biology of the pest or disease so that pesticide application can be aimed at the weakest, most vulnerable stage. Some stages of insects and mites, such as the egg stage, can seldom be controlled. Young larval or nymphal stages are more easily controlled and require less insecticide than older stages. Pupal stages are generally not affected by insecticides (large larvae nearing this stage are also difficult to control).

Once populations reach high numbers, even if 95 percent are controlled, the remaining 5 percent can still be a significant number. Further considerations must be made with regard to timing of greenhouse insect control, in particular: 16. Integrated pest management 469 • Mites and whiteflies should be controlled as soon as they are observed. Growers should not allow populations to reach high numbers. Sprays for mites and whiteflies should be spaced at no longer than 4–5-day intervals until control is achieved. • Worms and caterpillars should be controlled when 14 days old. • It is generally best to apply insecticides in the late afternoon or evening hours when temperatures start to fall. This also allows for maximum exposure time before the sprayed area is aired for employees; also, many insects are most active at night. The risk of phytotoxicity (burning) is greater when applications are made during the middle of the day. On the other hand, it has been reported that better mite control can be obtained by spraying early in the morning hours. As a rule, insecticide or miticide applications should be made while temperatures are low. A spray application time should be chosen when control, phytotoxicity, irrigation, temperature and worker re-entry considerations best fit the overall operation. • Insecticides should not be applied when plants are water stressed. Water- deficient plants are more subject to phytotoxicity damage. Step 5: Proper application of pesticides Proper application, like proper timing, is one of the most important steps in pest and disease control efforts. It does little good to complete the first four steps properly and then fail to deliver the material to the target area. There are numerous factors to be taken into account and various spray methods to consider for proper application of pesticides. Spray equipment must be properly calibrated. A calibration error can quickly result in under-dosing (not obtaining control) or overdosing (illegal and harmful). Application of the proper amount of material is closely related to calibration. Growers should purchase the specific equipment for the operation and the target pest or disease. Each pest and disease differs in habits and behaviour and one piece of equipment may not meet all needs. For example, tests involving equipment to control greenhouse mites varied widely in results. High volume sprayers provided 59% control, rotary atomizers 67%, and pulse jet applicators 8%. High volume sprayers have been used for years in greenhouses. They are popular, can accommodate a wide range of pesticide types, and offer flexibility in the operation. However, high volume sprayers require a great deal of labour, are time-consuming to use, and are considered low in application efficiency. It has been estimated that less than 10 percent of the active ingredient reaches the actual target using high volume systems. However, most pesticides are labelled for high volume application. As previously discussed, most greenhouse insects and mites GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 470 are found on the underside of the leaves making it difficult for the spray to reach the pest, especially for some insecticides with physical modes of action (such as soaps and oils). There has been extensive research into low volume methods of pesticide application in greenhouses: aerosol generators, foggers, rotary atomizers, electrostatic applicators, mist blowers and pulse jet applicators should be considered by growers. The drawback is that some low volume systems require special formulations and specific accessory equipment. Low volume equipment may use as much active ingredient per hectare as high volume units, but they use less carrier to apply the material. Low volume systems can be efficient in delivering pesticides as they include contact, fumigant or residual control, but their greatest advantage is the time saved. Each piece of equipment, whether high or low volume, has an advantage for a particular job. There is no perfect piece of equipment, so growers need to look carefully at all available options.

It should be noted that it is illegal to use some low volume spray equipment to apply pesticides in greenhouses. For the best results, knowledge of the pest or disease and its biology should be combined with the equipment’s specific capabilities. To reach the underside of the leaves in thick canopy crops, a driving, directed spray may be required; if the canopy crop is thin, a rolling fog, atomizer or electrostatic applicator may be appropriate. Many pesticides produce vapours that help control pests and pathogens, even when coverage is less than desired; nevertheless, proper coverage can enhance the fumigating properties of a pesticide. Some insecticides also encourage insects to move into those areas where they come into contact with the insecticides. Some new materials can translocate from the top of the leaf to the bottom, improving efficiency and compensating for the constraint of equipment that delivers spray best to the topside of the leaf. Even though greenhouse spray equipment is far from ideal, the most serious problem facing greenhouse vegetable growers remains the lack of registered, effective pesticides. For correct application of pesticides, proper maintenance of spray equipment and its numerous parts is essential. Many spray operations are hampered and effectiveness drastically reduced because the spray cannot be delivered at the proper pressure, droplet size or pattern due to excessive wear, improper adjustment, or broken or improperly working parts. Growers should regularly check nozzles and discs for wear and tear (greater when suspensions and wettable powder formulations are used) and replace them when they do not meet specifications. Workers need to understand spray pressure and have accurate gauges, as even minor inaccuracies can result in improper droplet size and failure 16. Integrated pest management 471 to deliver the desired coverage. Moreover, most pesticides are highly corrosive and react with hoses, lines, nozzles, tanks and other components, affecting the spray patterns and leading to the formation of foreign particles that clog the equipment. Therefore sanitation is important: • Spray should be used as soon as it is mixed, and the equipment thoroughly cleaned and rinsed immediately after spraying. • Workers must mix only sufficient spray for the job. Leftover spray can quickly destroy the sprayer, sprayer parts, lines and components. However, it must be carefully and legally disposed of if not used on the crop, as disposal of pesticides is an increasing environmental concern. Growers must plan carefully their requirements, use what is mixed, and clean up properly afterwards. • Spray equipment must be properly stored after cleaning to keep it free of dust, dirt and other foreign materials (e.g. pieces of rubber lines) that may enter the system, blocking it and causing poor spray patterns, particularly when pressure is applied. • Water is the most commonly used diluent (carrier) for pesticide sprays and it must be clean and free from contaminants. Water for the spray tank may contain dirt, sand or corrosion from the pipes or lines, or loading hoses and pipes can be dirty, causing severe problems to operations. Growers should filter water as many times as possible: between the source of water, the spray tank and where the water enters the tank; also between the tank and the final nozzle, so that the spray can flow and be delivered in the pattern according to equipment specifications. If a spray job needs repeating because of inaccurate pest or disease identification, or poor application or timing methods, potential profits can be reduced and the crop can be vulnerable to pests and diseases.

If a spray job needs repeating because of inaccurate pest or disease identification, or poor application or timing methods, potential profits can be reduced and the crop can be vulnerable to pests and diseases. Of all the factors and measures necessary for pest and disease control, none are more important than the overall proper delivery methods. Pesticides should be used as soon as they are mixed. Once mixed with water, the pesticide begins to change and its effective life can be only hours. Water with a pH of over 7.0 can be particularly detrimental to many pesticides; generally speaking, the higher the pH, the faster the pesticide is broken down and rendered useless. Under conditions where the underground water is frequently high in calcium carbonate (pH 8.0–8.5), it is even more important to not allow finished spray to stand longer than necessary. Storage of pesticides Only fresh pesticides should be used. Growers should try to purchase the quantity required and not plan to store materials for longer than a single season. Pesticides should not be left on the shelf longer than is necessary. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 472 Pesticides must be stored in a safe, dry location. The best storage temperatures are generally room temperature (20– 30 °C); temperatures over 40 °C are not recommended. Certain pesticides undergo undesirable changes if the storage temperature drops below freezing. Applicators must follow the label instructions for specific storage information. Applicators must follow local government laws with regard to storage sheds, locks and warning signs. Safety issues Pesticides can create serious problems when common sense and rules of safe use and handling are not used. The pesticide label is considered a legal document: “the label is the law”. It is the duty and legal responsibility of the user to read and understand all the directions and information on the label, and to seek interpretation of any unclear part. Pesticide dealers, manufacturers and their representatives, as well as the extension service can aid in interpreting pesticide labels. Lack of understanding of the label or misuse of a pesticide can have serious consequences. The label contains information on the safe use of its contents, protective clothing, worker contact, poisoning symptoms, disposal and other information. The user is encouraged to become familiar with all safety and other aspects of the label before use. CONCLUSIONS AND GAP RECOMMENDATIONS Numeros GAP codes, standards and regulations have been developed in recent years by the food industry and producers’ organizations and also by governments and NGOs, aiming to codify agricultural practices at farm level for a range of commodities. Their purpose varies from fulfillment of trade and government regulatory requirements (in particular with regard to food safety and quality), to more specific requirements of specialty or niche markets. The objectives of these GAP codes, standards and regulations include, to a varying degree: • ensuring safety and quality in the food chain; • capturing new market advantages by modifying supply chain governance; Plate 27 Safe locked storage system of pesticides, made from iron and well ventilated Note: No pesticides should be laid directly on the ground. Plate 28 Model of signalled panel displayed on the wall of pesticide storage (hazards) 16. Integrated pest management 473 • improving use of natural resources, workers’ health and working conditions; and • creating new market opportunities for farmers and exporters in developing countries. Good agricultural practices are “practices that address environmental, economic and social sustainability for on-farm processes, and result in safe and quality food and non-food agricultural products”. The four pillars of GAP (economic viability, environmental sustainability, social acceptability and food safety and quality) are included in most private and public sector standards, but the scope which they actually cover varies widely. The concept of GAP may serve as a reference tool for deciding, at each step in the production process, on practices and outcomes that are environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable. The implementation of GAP should therefore contribute to sustainable agriculture. In line with these GAP standards, maintaining a healthy greenhouse crop is more than essential for an economic and sustainable greenhouse vegetable and ornamental production. This requires first consistent monitoring, which involves systematically checking the greenhouse crop at regular intervals and at critical times to gather information about the crop, pests and their natural enemies, diseases and their antagonists.

Visual observation of symptoms, laboratory analyses of soils or plant parts, weather data, sticky colour traps and pheromone traps, are some of the available tools which should be used to collect the maximum information necessary for an informed decision to make sure there is a clear distinction between non-parasitic afflictions (plant stress and other physiological disorders) and those caused by pests and pathogens. If a grower does not have the technical expertise to properly identify the problem, it is strongly recommended to seek special diagnostician advice. Many countries have plant clinics, and correct identification by experienced diagnosticians can produce excellent results in the routine diagnosis of fairly familiar pests and diseases. The more often a crop is monitored, the more information a grower has about what is happening in the greenhouse. For an effective IPM programme, greenhouse workers have to be trained to recognize the symptoms of nutrient deficiency, disease, nematodes, mites and insects. In this regard, training of greenhouse workers to identify visible symptoms is of paramount importance in the early detection of abnormalities. Unlike most crops, workers in greenhouse crops have multiple opportunities to visit every plant in the greenhouse (pruning, training, Plate 29 Training workers and pest control managers in the recognition of insects pests is crucial to IPM success GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 474 harvesting etc.). Their observations could be of great help in the early detection of spot infections or infestation by pathogens and pests. Personal protective gear, disinfectants, disposal bins, markers etc. have to be made available to greenhouse workers so that they can play adequately their role in an IPM programme. In large operations, it is recommended to have a site map of the greenhouses and a good record-keeping system so that disease and pest outbreaks as well as management actions can be noted for the information of all greenhouse staff (IPM is about “teamwork”). GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR IPM IN GREENHOUSES The careful integration of all IPM strategies and the implementation of GAP taking account of the various aspects of pest and disease management should follow the guidelines outlined in the four points below. However, if a grower does not have sufficient expertise, it is strongly recommended that the advice of extension staff or a plant clinic be sought. 1. IPM at nursery level The nursery is the first source of healthy or contaminated planting material with many pests and diseases of greenhouse crops (insects, mites, nematodes, foliar pathogens, soil pathogens etc.). • Use certified high quality seed. • Use resistant or tolerant varieties and rootstocks as available in the market. • Produce seedlings in conditions that ensure vigorous plantlets: a healthy start facilitates implementation of IPM further down the road; if seedlings are contaminated (viruses or soil-borne pathogens) at an early stage, very little can be done after transplanting to save the crop even with the best IPM programme. • Produce plantlets in a separate greenhouse equipped with very fine mesh on all ventilation openings and a reliable SAS (with foot pad and sponge impregnated with disinfectant), and systematic hand-washing with disinfectant solution by nursery workers and visitors prior to access to the nursery. • Use only clean or virgin substrate. • Use adequate irrigation and fertilization management to avoid exposing plantlets to stress conducive to diseases and pests. Plate 30 Personal protective gear is mandatory for pesticide operators 16. Integrated pest management 475 • Avoid water saturation and provide an environment suitable for plantlets and unfavourable to pests and pathogens. • Monitor closely pests, diseases and physiological disorders at all stages. • Implement strict sanitary measures at all stages: - Authorize specialized personnel only to enter the nursery space. - Prohibit cigars, cigarettes and chewing tobacco to prevent viral diseases. - Do not touch plantlets unless absolutely necessary. - Make sure that all equipment (trays, tools etc.) is disinfected to avoid any source of contaminant (there is a major risk of contaminants – pests but most importantly pathogens – in reused trays). - Spray growing nursery areas (walkways and benches) with chlorine solutions. • Apply only registered pesticides as required by GAP protocols. • Do not raise seedlings directly on", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Questions to ask for good decision-making before applying IPM • What pests and diseases are causing problems and what is their incidence, numbers and stage of development in the specific greenhouse crop? • What specific conditions might have a direct or indirect effect on the increase or decrease of pests and diseases in question? • What is the status of natural enemies and antagonists of pests and diseases and are they playing an important role in the regulation of the pests and diseases concerned? • What is the stage of development, condition of the crop and will it be economical to engage in an IPM programme? • What management options are available and will their implementation justify the economic cost of the IPM programme? • If pesticides are the only feasible option, how should intelligent and effective chemical control be implemented following the steps outlined in this chapter? GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 476 2. Pest and disease management before planting Apply strict sanitary measures. Sanitation is by far the most effective and cheapest way of escaping disease epidemics and pest outbreaks. The cliché “it is much cheaper to stay clean than to become clean” applies here. • Crop residues from the previous crop cycle should be destroyed immediately after the final harvest. The greenhouse should be thoroughly cleaned before planting a new or first-time crop. This means burning, burying or hauling away all leftover roots and other plant material from the previous crop. • Adequate solarization or soil disinfection (if required) should take place during the crop-free period especially in warm regions. If the above fails to bring soil-borne pathogens and nematodes to a manageable level, the grower is then advised to move to soilless culture. • All weeds from the greenhouse space should be eliminated before planting as they might harbour some pests and diseases and become the source of contamination of clean planting material. • Soil and plant debris should be adequately washed from farm equipment when moving from one greenhouse to another to avoid spread of pests and diseases to clean crops. • Before planting the new crop, growers should thoroughly clean or disinfect the greenhouse structure. • It is recommended to apply fine 50-mesh (thrips-proof) insect nets to all aeration openings of the greenhouse and to use an SAS at the entry of the production greenhouse to mechanically reduce the chances of insect pests and vectors accessing the greenhouse space. The SAS should be equipped with a foot pad as well as a disinfectant solution for systematic use by greenhouse workers and visitors for disinfecting before entering the greenhouse.

Crop schedules are an important factor in IPM. Where there is a risk of disease being more destructive in cool soils (e.g. fusarium crown and root rot and corky root rot), transplanting should be delayed until the root zone has warmed up. Where two or more crops are grown each year, overlapping of planting dates between the different greenhouses and uncontrolled movement of workers between these crops means that pest and pathogen populations are spread from the old greenhouse crops to the young crops, unless special care is taken regarding worker movement between crops. • Adopt cultural practices to maximize biological and natural prevention of pests and diseases, including: choice of the greenhouse location; use of adequate greenhouse structure with appropriate climate conditions; adoption of good soil management; use of quality water and adoption of irrigation management; use of adequate and balanced fertilization; enforcement of sanitary measures before planting, during production and at the end of the crop cycle. • Observe proper sanitary measures in and around the production greenhouse before planting and throughout the crop cycle. • Properly dispose of infected plants or debris (in bins or plastic bags). • Enforce strict hand-scrubbing rules for workers involved in pruning, pollinating, tying or harvesting activities. • Use appropriate tools (visual observation, insect colour traps, pheromone traps etc.) for reliable and regular scouting of pests and diseases before and after planting in the greenhouse, in order to make informed disease management decisions (using ET as available), taking into account the quantitative and qualitative assessment of the balance status between pests and diseases and their natural enemies. • Adopt all possible methods of pest and disease management discussed herein (biological control, physical control, mechanical control, cultural control, biorational pesticides etc.), considering the short- and long-term impact on greenhouse crop productivity and quality as well as the impact on the environment and human health, with the aim of minimizing the use of toxic pesticides. • Apply safe and intelligent chemical control. Plate 33 Foot disinfectant pad at the entrance to a greenhouse Note: Ideally the foot bath should cover all walking space of the SAS. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 478 With regard to chemical control, it is advised to use only registered pesticides as required by GAP protocols. While other control tactics require fewer precautionary measures, chemical pesticides necessitate the diligent application of precautionary measures, outlined below: • Use exclusively pesticides registered with the relevant national registration authority and approved for use on the specific greenhouse crop and in line with the GAP protocols. • Handle, store, apply and dispose of pesticides in accordance with the instructions on the label and in line with the international conventions on pesticides. • Never transport pesticides, passengers (humans or animals) and food in the same vehicle. • Only use pesticides when needed and only at the dose prescribed – application of the minimum recommended dose lowers costs and reduces risks of pesticide residues in produce and contamination of the environment. • Read instructions for application of a particular pesticide before use and carefully consider all information: restrictions for use (beneficial insects, pollinators etc.), application rate, approved doses, compatibility with other substances, mixing properties, minimal intervals between application and harvesting (pre-harvest period). • Pay special attention to spray equipment, pumps and nozzles used to apply pesticides: to minimize potential risks of over- or under-dosage, accidents and spills, all equipment should be calibrated for accuracy and checked on a regular basis for any malfunction; spray equipment should be washed after each treatment to prevent contamination of produce with compounds not authorized for the specific crop (GAP protocol). • Keep all pesticides in clearly labelled containers (original containers advised) and store safely away from children, anyone who might misuse them, animals and all water sources. The GAP protocol specifies that containers should be kept in a safe storehouse, which in turn should be: well ventilated; equipped for closing off to prevent unauthorized entry; far from populated areas; on well-drained land; far from domestic water supplies; constructed with non-combustible material; fitted with a leak-proof floor and", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Small greenhouse farmers should keep pesticides in a locking ventilated cupboard or cabinet preferably made from iron. • Absorb pesticide spillage with sand or sawdust and then sweep up and dispose of appropriately; clean the floor with detergent and water. Plate 34 Example of good agricultural practices (adequate pruning and plant training) 16. Integrated pest management 479 • Use appropriate masks and protective gear as recommended on the label; personnel must clean and bathe following application. • Do not spray pesticides in strong wind conditions, especially in naturally ventilated greenhouses, to avoid pesticide drift. • Adhere strictly to maximum residue limits (MRL) for each pesticide used and for each specific crop. The MRL is the maximum level of residue legally allowed in or on greenhouse produce to provide reasonable assurance that the consumer will have no adverse effects over a lifetime dietary exposure. • Wash empty pesticide containers multiple times and keep in an appropriate place until disposed of correctly; never put in unused wells or near water sources. • Make personnel aware of the dangers that can result from improper use of pesticides. Give training in the use and application of pesticides and use of safety equipment and application devices. Inform greenhouse workers that adverse health effects caused by inappropriate use of pesticides are most often not noticeable immediately or in the short term (acute toxicity), but can develop over time (chronic toxicity) if exposure is not reduced. Provide personnel involved in the manipulation of pesticides with the necessary protective gear and appropriate spraying equipment to meet GAP and FAO standards. • Avoid crop damage: always consult the label as some chemicals may cause phytotoxicity to certain crops under specific conditions; before application, consider the stage of plant development, the pH of the water used in the mixture, the soil type and conditions, the temperature, moisture and wind conditions; make operators aware that phytotoxicity often results from mixing incompatible materials. • Make safety a priority: follow label directions carefully; avoid splashing, spilling, leaks, spray drift and contamination of clothing; do not eat, smoke, drink or chew while using pesticides; provide for emergency medical care in advance as required by regulations. • In line with GAP standards and protocol, keep records of pesticide applications. Pesticide application records • Date of application • Greenhouse location or number • Information on the pesticide (commercial name, active ingredient) • Dosage and volume of spray applied per unit area • Operator name for monitoring purposes • Common name of target pest, disease or weed • Pest/disease/weed level of infestation or risk as justification for the treatment • First permitted harvest date GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 480 4. Pest and disease management in organic greenhouse production With the exception of chemical pesticides, the above management techniques apply almost equally to conventional or GAP-certified and to organic-certified greenhouse crop production. While chemical pesticide use is strictly prohibited in organic greenhouse production systems, a wide range of biorational pesticides are allowed. Therefore, many of the above recommendations concerning pesticide use also apply to compounds authorized in organic greenhouse production: • minerals, including sulphur, copper and diatomaceous earth • botanicals, including neem, pyrethrum and other new plant extracts • oils and soaps, including a number of commercially available soap-based products • pheromones used for monitoring and mass trapping or in sexual disruption techniques • microbials, including the fast-growing biopesticide products Appropriate adoption and monitoring of GAP helps improve the safety and quality of food and other agricultural products. It may help reduce the risk of non-compliance with national and international regulations, standards and guidelines, notably of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) regarding permitted pesticides, maximum levels of contaminants (including pesticides and mycotoxins) in food and non-food agricultural products, as well as other chemical, microbiological and physical contamination", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Awareness-raising is needed with regard to “win-win” practices which lead to improvements in terms of yield and production efficiencies as well as environment and health and safety of workers. One such approach is integrated production and pest management (IPPM). Plate 35 Organic certified produce: the result of good implementation of IPM, GAP and organic certified produce protocols Adoption of GAP helps promotes sustainable agriculture and contributes to meeting national and international environment and social development objectives. 16.

Integrated pest management and farmer education: FAO experiences from the Near East and the Maghreb Ashraf S. AlHawamdeh,a Marjon Fredrix b and Alfredo Impiglia c a National Center for Agricultural Research and Extension NCARE, Amman, Jordan b Food and Agriculture Organization, Rome, Italy c Food and Agriculture Organization, Tunis, Tunisia BACKGROUND General Integrated pest management (IPM) approaches were first developed in the 1950s. After the Second World War, the predominant thinking in plant protection was that pesticides were the sole answer to pest problems. However, in the 1950s, major pest outbreaks were observed on crops like cotton that had been heavily sprayed following a calendar of regular applications, and pesticide use was challenged as a consequence: the disruption of natural biological control and the development of resistance to pesticides caused a resurgence of pest insects. IPM was a response to situations where chemical pesticides had been perceived as the sole and infallible form of pest control (and such situations predominated in the post-war period). IPM approaches underline the importance of understanding the biology and ecology of pests and diseases, as well as the complex relations between the different elements of agro-ecosystems, when managing pest populations. In the 1960s, there was increased awareness of the environmental and health problems potentially caused by pesticides, following the publication in 1963 of Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson. Since then, IPM approaches have continued to gain importance, albeit with sometimes diverging views on how IPM is best implemented. Farmers are their own managers, making decisions about which interventions are needed and when. For the implementation of quality IPM, farmers must be ecologically literate. They require knowledge of the main elements of the agro-ecosystem, and they must recognize different creatures and problems, understanding the relations between elements and how specific interventions can influence balances in the system, both immediately and in the course of the cropping season. Farmers often have years of experience and understand GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 512 local conditions better than anyone else. However, there may be gaps in their knowledge, especially with regard to pests and their natural enemies, organisms causing diseases, and creatures that are small or not visible to the human eye. Managing such pests is difficult; this is particularly true for the many smallholder farmers that have little access to formal education, to government or private extension services, or to other information sources. Providing support to farmers to improve their ecological literacy has been an area of attention and activity for many organizations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In the late 1980s, an education approach – the farmer field school (FFS) – was developed as part of an FAO IPM programme on rice in Asia, for farmers to learn about IPM for rice. The FFS approach has since been introduced in over 80 countries and is used to enhance knowledge on IPM for a wide range of crops, but IPM is not the sole focus of FFSs. In 2004, FAO’s Regional IPM Programme in the Near East – GTFS/REM/070/ITA – provided support to smallholder farmers to learn about IPM in vegetable and fruit production using the FFS methodology.1 Some FFSs were conducted with greenhouse farmers, and in some cases, the FFS groups also linked to private GAP systems. The experiences of the IPM farmer field scools are discussed herein, and some thoughts for the future are provided. Greenhouse vegetable production in the Near East and the Maghreb In all of the countries in the Near East and the Maghreb, farmers grow vegetables in greenhouses as well as in the open field. However, conditions for greenhouse agriculture vary from country to country, and within countries. Differences exist in ecology and environment (climate, soils, crops, pests and diseases), with implications for production. Socio-economic contexts vary: some farmers are educated in agriculture, have relatively large farms, have the means to invest in their farms and are commercially oriented; while others have small land holdings and limited means to invest, have had limited access to education in agriculture and meet more obstacles to entering markets. Furthermore, smallholder farmers generally have less access to agricultural service providers and to information. However, a steady increase in greenhouse cultivation has been observed in the region, as shown for example in Table 1. 1 The Regional Near East IPM Programme started in 2004 with six member countries (Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the Syrian Arab Republic). In 2009, four more countries joined the project (Algeria, Iraq, Morocco and Tunisia). The programme is supported by the Government of Italy. 17.

IPM and farmer education: FAO experiences from the Near East and the Maghreb 513 Despite differences, smallholders in the Near East region often face similar problems. • Pests and diseases. (Greenhouse) farmers frequently report problems related to pests and diseases. However, they often have only limited knowledge of what causes the symptoms observed, of the ecology and biology of major pests and diseases. The natural enemy concept is not always understood; how to use biological control and why is not well known. Furthermore, in many cases biological control is simply not available, or not available in time, or perceived to be too costly. Farmers rarely implement systematic monitoring of pests and diseases in greenhouses as the basis for plant protection decisions. This frequently leads to overuse and abuse of pesticides, contributing to economic inefficiencies in pest management, and sometimes causing pesticide residues in excess of acceptable standards. Pesticide residues can affect consumer health and negatively influence market access, especially for export markets (to a lesser extent domestic markets which often do not set standards). • Production issues. There is much room for improving the quantity and quality of production in vegetable greenhouses: – Management of fertilization and irrigation systems is often not optimal. – Pollination of crops often depends on hormones. – Small farmers often have poor greenhouse structures, but there may be scope for improvement with quite simple low-cost interventions. • Lack of organization. In addition to not being very well organized, small farmers have limited access to extension services. • Marketing. Most production is sold in domestic markets, and accessing export markets is difficult for small farmers. • Labour. Family labour is often the main source of labour in the farm, though there might be additional labour hired for specific periods of the season.

MAKING IPM WORK – EDUCATING FARMERS THROUGH FFS Basics of a farmer field school An FFS is a season-long non-formal education programme conducted in the field; it brings together a group of farmers (15–25 people) interested in learning about a particular crop. The FFS group sets up a study field on land or in greenhouses belonging to one of the group members in order to experiment new innovative techniques; the results are then compared with those in another farmer field in the area where local practices are used. The FFS meets regularly, normally once a week. During these meetings the participants follow a programme that includes AgroEcoSystem Analysis (AESA), a group dynamics activity and a special topic (see opposite). The FFS is supported by a facilitator trained in strengthening technical and methodological skills. The facilitator can be a field agent from a government service, an NGO or a trained farmer-facilitator. The process in the FFS is always learner-centred and participatory, and relies on an experiential learning approach. Field schools aim to enhance the knowledge and skills of farmers, but also to strengthen social interactions and social capital at community level, and to empower farmers in their daily lives. Principles of IPM in the FFS IPM needs to be adapted to meet specific requirements in a location, reflecting ecological conditions, as well as socio-economic and cultural circumstances: a “one size fits all” technical package does not work. In farmer field schools, a set of IPM principles are used to guide a process of validating and adapting ideas and technologies generated outside the community, and to reinforce farmers’ knowledge and skills for making informed field management decisions. The IPM principles are as follows: • Grow a healthy crop. IPM is not limited to pests and diseases, but includes all other aspects of production. The first principle, growing a healthy crop, refers to all relevant cultural practices: soil preparation, variety selection, Plate 1 Greenhouse preparation, IPM/FFS Iraq A. EZAWI, GTFS/REM/070/ITA-FAO, 2011 17. IPM and farmer education: FAO experiences from the Near East and the Maghreb 515 A session in a farmer field school • AgroEcoSystem Analysis. AESA is the principal tool in field decisions and it enables a comparison between the local practice (LP) and IPM. Working in small groups of 5–6, farmers make observations in the FFS study fields (IPM and LP). They observe different elements: climatic conditions, soil conditions, plant development, pests and diseases, natural enemies, weeds. They then make a poster summarizing their observations in the field, using mainly drawings. They analyse the situation and discuss the management decisions for the week to come. Each group then presents its findings to the plenary, and all participants discuss what should be done in the IPM field the following week. The facilitator guides the group towards a technically sound decision. AESA helps farmers come to informed decisions, based on field observations. • Group dynamics. The FFS also aims to enhance collaboration between farmers. Group dynamic exercises are held: they are fun and an opportunity to learn about issues such as collaboration, team building and problem solving. Learning points from exercises are discussed and applied to the FFS setting. • Special topics. Special topics are identified together with the group. They may be of a technical nature, but can also touch upon other relevant issues. Whenever possible, they are field- based and experimental.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 516 • Conserve natural enemies and enhance biological control. In open field systems, natural enemies occur and provide free ecosystem services by controlling pest insects through predation or parasitization. Conserving natural enemies helps to keep pest populations in check, and is an integral part of the decision-making process. Well-designed systems of introduced biological control have been developed for greenhouses to keep pest populations at low levels. Where possible, biological control can be introduced in greenhouses for pest management. • Farmers as experts in their exploitation. Farmers are at the centre of quality IPM. They need knowledge to make good decisions, and they need to know when and where to find additional information and advice when specific (new) problems arise. The IPM/FFS covers more than pests and diseases, looks at the different production aspects, and emphasizes the role of farmers as expert decision-makers. A curriculum for an FFS is always adapted to the local situation at the preparation stage and during discussion with participants. Testing and validating IPM approaches Farmers possess local knowledge and experience in greenhouse management. The FFS provides an opportunity to test and validate different approaches generated by research or other sources, and to adapt them to the local setting. The IPM principles provide a guide for carrying out a comparative study and setting up a learning field (greenhouse). In addition to the FFS’s IPM greenhouse, a second greenhouse is used, in which the local practices, commonly adopted in the area, are applied. Weekly AESA observations in both greenhouses allow participants to observe the dynamics and changes, to discuss why differences occur and experiment what seems the best method for a given setting. The FFS provides a space to adapt management strategies to local conditions, taking into account ecological and socio-economic conditions, as well as access to and availability of options. Throughout the FFS, participants collect field data and economic data in order to compare IPM with local practices. Common problems, local solutions Managing soil-borne diseases Soil-borne fungus diseases can be a problem in greenhouses, because of limited possibilities for crop rotation. Several years ago, methyl bromide (MBr) was widely used for chemical soil disinfestation, but due to its negative effects on the ozone layer, it is being phased out. Other solutions include soil solarization, biofumigation, use of antagonists and the use of grafted seedlings. In Jordan, soil solarization (sometimes in combination with grafted seedlings) is used by many farmers in the Jordan Valley, where climatic conditions favour this technique. In other countries, such as Morocco, soil solarization is not feasible, because temperatures are not high enough. The use of grafted seedlings is more common, 17. IPM and farmer education: FAO experiences from the Near East and the Maghreb 517 sometimes in combination with chemical disinfestation (but not with MBr). In the Syrian Arab Republic, FFSs experimented with techniques including Verticillium, an antagonist incorporated in the soil in the greenhouses to reduce disease pressure. Biological control in greenhouses In Morocco there are capital-intensive farms producing large quantities of vegetables in greenhouses, often destined for export markets, and certain standards of quality must be met. Biological control programmes are quite common: commercial firms produce the natural enemies needed and provide technical support. However, smallholders in Morocco have less access to such programmes: they might not have enough information, or may lack the required knowledge or perceive biological control as too costly. FFSs introduced some programmes to find out what might and might not work in a smallholder context. In Jordan, biological control programmes in greenhouses are not very well developed; this could be due to the very high temperatures which hamper natural enemies. Types of greenhouse The types of greenhouse vary. Some farmers invest in large sophisticated greenhouses (i.e. multispan greenhouses) in which climatic conditions can be controlled relatively easily. Others have simple plastic tunnel greenhouses made of rudimental material. Adaptations can be made to include insect-proof netting to keep out pests, or to install a simple double-door system. Simple improvements can be introduced to better ventilate the greenhouse – very important for managing certain fungal diseases.

Tuta absoluta – tomato leafminer Several years ago, a new pest was introduced in the Maghreb and it then moved to the Near East countries: the tomato leafminer. It spread rapidly in the region, initially causing substantial damage and losses for tomato growers; it was a major cause for concern. Attempts to control the leafminer with pesticides were not successful due to the biology of the insect. On the other hand, IPM gave good results: the introduction of pheromones, combined with mass trapping, Plate 5 Preparation of soil solarization, IPM/FFS Iran (Islamic Republic of) A. IMPIGLIA, GTFS/REM/070/ITA-FAO, 2009 Plate 6 Larva of lady beetle feeding on aphid, IPM/FFS Jordan A. ALHAWAMDEH, GTFS/REM/070/ITA-FAO, 2012 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 518 rapidly reduced the pressure of Tuta; biological control programmes have been successfully implemented in Morocco, but not yet in Near East countries. In Jordan, the Regional IPM Programme in the Near East implemented a compact strategy to control Tuta absoluta. By the end of the first year of the introduction of this insect, two groups from Morocco and Algeria visited Jordan and met with farmers to discuss the best way to manage the pest (farmers were already meeting regularly to discuss the status of the insect in their fields so as to be prepared in the case of an outbreak). Members of the project team participated in two regional symposia for IPM of Tuta absoluta to share experiences among project members and exchange knowledge, to then be integrated into activities with farmers. The FFS farmers play an important role in helping the MOA (Ministry of Agriculture) and NCARE record the first appearance of the insect each year by properly using pheromone traps. Based on the population density, they then apply microbial pesticides (e.g. Bt) and record the results. An FFS (now an association) takes the lead, and after receiving the pheromones from the ministry, they distribute them to other farmers in the same area and ensure proper monitoring using the traps, recording findings and following up as necessary. Bumblebees Many farmers use growth hormones to pollinate the crop: bumblebees are an alternative and tomatoes pollinated by bumblebees are of better quality. However, there are constraints: bumblebee hives are not always available when they are needed and they can be costly. Post-harvest crop waste and residues When a crop is harvested, there is often produce that is of insufficient quality for marketing. Farmers typically leave most of this behind in the greenhouses, between the rows. In FFSs in Jordan, farmers discuss the importance of this waste – a potential source Plate 7 Bumblebees, IPM/FFS Jordan A. ALHAWAMDEH, GTFS/REM/070/ITA-FAO, 2011 Tuta absoluta IPM strategy, Jordan • Early monitoring before planting the crop; this was easily performed by FFS farmers who had been well trained in scouting and monitoring the insect by a specialist who had visited Morocco to exchange knowledge and learn from their experience. • Distribution by NCARE (National Center for Agricultural Research and Extension), with the support of the IPM/ FFS regional project, of more than 20 000 pheromone traps for Tuta; these were monitored by farmers and facilitators, while farmers ensured that greenhouses were fully closed to prevent the insect from entering. 17.

Since 2004, approximately 1 100 FFSs have been organized on a range of vegetable and fruit crops (tomato, cucumber, watermelon, mint, grape, strawberry, date palm, apple, citrus, olive), and about 16 000 farmers have been trained in IPM and good agricultural practices (GAP), about 10 percent of whom are women. Also FFSs were organized on greenhouse crops – cucumber and tomato in particular – in several countries, and an overview is given below.

The indicators include information on pesticide use, use of fertilizers, yields and economics. Results for FFS activities in greenhouses from the project database are summarized below. Information is also provided on pesticide use, use of fertilizers, yields and economics, comparing IPM and LP fields in the greenhouse FFSs in different countries. The data were collected by facilitators, and were included in the regional project database. Data for the Maghreb countries are based on a limited number of FFS activities implemented in the period 2010–11. Greenhouse tomato Chemical pesticide use in the region is reduced from an average of 19.4 applications per season under LP to 7.4 applications under IPM. The use of biopesticides increases from 0.1 applications in LP to 0.6 in IPM. Naturally, quite large differences exist between countries: in Morocco greenhouse tomato is a very intensive culture, and averages are higher than in other countries. However, in all countries a substantial reduction (41–71 percent) in the use of chemical pesticides can be observed in the IPM plots. Solarization was widely used in the Near East countries to manage soil-borne diseases, but not in the Maghreb (due to differences in climate and cultural practices). In the IPM plots in the three Near East countries, 45 fields out of 64 used solarization, compared with 16 fields out of 64 under LP. Methyl bromide was used in none of the 64 IPM fields, against 28 of the 64 LP fields.

For greenhouse tomato, fertilizer use in IPM study fields is lower than in LP; however, the organic fertilizer amounts are similar. In the region as a whole, average yield levels in the IPM fields are higher than in the LP, with variations at country level. The IPM fields produced more benefits than the LP fields, as a result of the lower production costs and/or a higher production value.2 Greenhouse cucumber In the region, chemical pesticide use is reduced from 16.8 applications per season to 7.0 applications. The use of biopesticides in IPM is somewhat higher than in LP: 0.2 versus 0.1 applications. Differences exist between countries. However, in all cases the use of chemical pesticides in IPM is substantially reduced, by between 53 and 65 percent. 2 Yields in Jordan are lower than in the other countries due to the particular climatic conditions in the Jordan Valley. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 522 Solarization was widely used to deal with soil-borne diseases. In the IPM plots, 50 out of 58 fields used solarization, compared with 29 out of 58 fields under LP. Methyl bromide was used in none of the 58 IPM fields, and in 3 of the 58 LP fields. Data collected after mid-2009 show that none of the LP fields used MBr. Soil analysis is used frequently in the IPM study fields, allowing for a reduction in the use of chemical fertilizers. In Jordan, average yields levels in IPM are slightly lower than in LP, while they are higher in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Benefits in the IPM fields are higher than in the LP fields, due to lower production costs and/or a higher production value.

IPM and farmer education: FAO experiences from the Near East and the Maghreb 523 SOCIAL CHANGE Farmer field schools allow farmers to compare IPM and local practices, and to evaluate technical and economic differences. Farmers report additional gains obtained from their FFS experience, including, among others, improved cohesion and collaboration with other farmers, increased self-confidence, and better linkages with government/NGO staff. Examples of other reported positive developments are detailed below. Social capital strengthened in FFS Farmers become facilitators. In most of the project countries farmers have become facilitators. Following participation in an FFS, they indicate interest in organizing an FFS for others in the community. With additional training and support, farmer- facilitators play a key role in their community to train others, and take a lead in community development (see below). Farmer-facilitators Jordan Ms Lema Noem is a Jordanian farmer who has been involved in IPM/FFS activities since 2004. She was trained to become an IPM/FFS facilitator for one group of greenhouse tomato growers in her village. At the time, she was working with her father on his farm: young, with limited experience and no experience at all of dealing with other farmers. She joined the training, gained knowledge on technical issues and improved her self-confidence. Her first FFS was with 12 farmers (including 5 women). In the second year, she facilitated a group of 14 female farmers. Neighbouring farmers then began asking her for advice on crop and pest management. In 2007, her father died and her family asked her to manage the family farm. Now, she is a leader and a focal point in the area. She recently established an association in the village for female farmers to provide support to women in agriculture. Syrian Arab Republic Mr Masheer Al Rihea is a greenhouse tomato grower living in Ras Al Ein village, Lattakia Province. After attending an IPM/FFS as participant, he was selected to be a facilitator to train other farmers in the village. “In 2005,” Mr Al Rihea says, “I used to rely on pesticide companies to know what I had to spray. I reached up to 30 sprayings a season. When I joined the FFS group, I learnt about IPM and alternatives to pesticides. Then, I learnt a new technique to me, called the Agro-Eco System Analysis (AESA), to monitor my crop regularly and to consider all factors related to the crop, such as weather conditions, stage of the crop’s growth, and pest developments. I eliminated the use of insecticides by introducing biological control. I can say that I improved my decision-making skills through the participatory approach adopted by the FFS. Then, I conducted FFS for my people of the village, I was so happy when they decided to join the FFS.” GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 524 Farmers create associations, marketing groups The FFS experience leads to the creation of associations (see below). Associations Morocco In Morocco, a group of farmers who had participated in an IPM/FFS, created two associations when the FFS came to an end. Producers of mint in Laghnimyine and Beniyagrine are now organized in associations that help them to better access subsidies for the acquisition of agricultural inputs (biocompost, biopesticides) and small equipment (small tools, sprayers, mechanical harvester).

IPM and farmer education: FAO experiences from the Near East and the Maghreb 525 From farmers to consumers • 2010, IPM Group established in the Islamic Republic of Iran, with support from the Regional Near East project, to help smallholder farmers better market their IPM products, while helping consumers access healthier food. • Membership currently over 300. • USD100 (approx.) membership fee contributed by every member to cover initial administrative costs. • Linkages (direct and short) promoted between producers and consumers leading to a relationship based on trust – no formal certification. • Direct sale of IPM products from producer to consumer through the Group, with objective of enlarging the network and formalizing collaboration with farmers’ and consumers’ cooperatives. • January 2011, shop space allocated by the Municipality of Tehran to the IPM Group inside one of the public fruit and vegetable markets in the north of Tehran. • February 2011, space allocated to the IPM Group within the Iranian Research Institute for Plant Protection’s consumer cooperative store for the promotion of IPM products. • Current objective: expand activities in Tehran and other provinces. • Other activities: organization of seminars, short trainings and information days on relevant subjects for members. Farmers linking with consumers The FFS experience does not stop at the farmer. The FAO Near East project also helped establish the link between farmers and consumers: marketing skills for farmers, healthier products for consumers (see below). CONSTRAINTS AND CHALLENGES IN IPM/FFS PROGRAMMES IPM/FFSs build a good understanding of ecology to help strengthen knowledge and skills and they allow farmers to modify their practices, for example, reducing the use of pesticides and increasing fertilizer-use efficiency, resulting in similar or slightly improved yield levels and greater benefits. In the FFSs on greenhouses, efforts have been made to introduce and enhance biological control. Farmers learn about the larger production system, as well as about pest management. IPM/ FFSs provide a doorway towards sustainable crop production intensification – the “Save and Grow” approach promoted by FAO www.fao.org. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 526 Nevertheless, there are constraints, and the programmes continue to face challenges (listed below). • Farmer field schools require time and resources. Facilitators need to be trained to have appropriate technical and facilitation skills, and they need to be available to conduct the FFS. Sufficient time is needed to prepare the FFS. Farmers need to be informed and convinced to join. The local production system needs to be understood in order to design a curriculum relative to the precise context. • Quality of farmer field schools is the key to its success. Active support is needed during the season to identify problems and to overcome them, whether technical or methodological. Refresher courses are required for facilitators to update their skills regularly. • Access to bumblebees and biological control can be difficult for farmers, even when they are aware and convinced of the advantages. Biocontrol agents are not always available (or not available in time) and can have high costs, and quality problems may arise in some places. In some areas, commercial companies provide biocontrol, in others there is a government service. In the latter case, natural enemies may be provided free of charge or at a nominal price, but there might be a limited capacity and planning for the production and delivery of biocontrol agents to interested farmers. For IPM in greenhouses, in particular, biological control provides a technically sound alternative to pesticides, and should be made", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

For IPM in greenhouses, in particular, biological control provides a technically sound alternative to pesticides, and should be made increasingly available also to smallholders. • Enabling environment. Even when farmers are convinced of the usefulness of IPM, they continue to meet constraints. Contradicting messages or programmes can arrive from the government or private sector, leading to confusion for farmers. In some countries, FFSs have been integrated into government programmes; in others, FFSs are taken up by different projects. • Marketing. Many trained farmers reason that IPM products are of higher quality, since they are produced with fewer pesticides, and they therefore expect to obtain premium prices. This is often not the case. Certification for IPM is not common in the area, and where it does exist, standards are not always very well defined or protected. Linking to existing (private) certification systems, such as GAP, could be a solution. Linking IPM with GAP systems Good agricultural practices (GAP) systems have been gaining ground in recent years. In the Near East and the Maghreb, the private GLOBALG.A.P. system, developed by major supermarket chains, is in place in some countries. Numerous FFS groups wish to gain better access to markets. Linking with GLOBALG.A.P. is an option, and efforts have been made to achieve this. Some 17. IPM and farmer education: FAO experiences from the Near East and the Maghreb 527 of the FFS groups in the Occupied Palestinian Territory underwent additional training to become GLOBALG.A.P. certified. For smallholder farmers, however, there are constraints to becoming certified for GLOBALG.A.P. (see below). It remains a challenge for smallholders (trained or untrained) to become GLOBALG.A.P. certified. However, at the same time, products for domestic markets do not necessarily have to meet quality standards. Developing GAP standards endorsed by ministries to ensure good practices in agriculture, guarantee a minimum set of standards to protect both producers and consumers, and enhance proper conditions of work in farms could be an appropriate approach for the Near East and the Maghreb region. The ASEAN GAP for fruits and vegetables could serve as an example. THOUGHTS FOR THE FUTURE – PROMOTING IPM AND GAP IN THE REGION • Stimulate a regional discussion on GAP for fruits and vegetables with the aim of enhancing more sustainable crop intensification and promoting a minimum set of standards of production and working conditions to protect producers, farm workers and consumers both within and outside the region. • Actively promote ecological literacy among farmers, in particular smallholders, to develop the knowledge and skills needed to produce high quality fruits and vegetables. Ensure that relevant government NGO staff receive the necessary training to guide a process of learning. • Identify enabling policies to enhance GAP, and take necessary action. Constraints to GLOBALG.A.P . certification • The cost is perceived as an obstacle. • Smallholders may only be able to deliver limited quantities of produce. • Group certification, although cheaper, requires good organization – often lacking with small farmers’ groups. • Certification requires regular renewal, for a fee. • Farmers lack confidence that the certification will pay off: they fear not being able to sell their produce at better prices, whether sales are destined for export or specialized domestic markets; they fear having to sell their products in the domestic market at the same price as non-certified products. • Investments in farm infrastructure required to meet GLOBALG.A.P. requirements can be problematic for smallholders. 529 18. Harvest and post-harvest management Errol W. Hewett Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand INTRODUCTION Farmers grow horticultural crops to make money. To be successful they must deliver products to buyers who are so pleased with the quality and value of that product that they will purchase them again and again. Growers must therefore continuously satisfy consumer needs and desires for fresh greenhouse-grown products by using all the available technology and knowledge to produce, harvest, package, store, transport and market their products. Production should be consumer driven.

Harvest and post-harvest management Errol W. Hewett Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand INTRODUCTION Farmers grow horticultural crops to make money. To be successful they must deliver products to buyers who are so pleased with the quality and value of that product that they will purchase them again and again. Growers must therefore continuously satisfy consumer needs and desires for fresh greenhouse-grown products by using all the available technology and knowledge to produce, harvest, package, store, transport and market their products. Production should be consumer driven. Growers need to comprehend the nature of the market where they sell their products. They must understand the factors that influence product quality and affect deterioration after harvest. Delivery of greenhouse-grown vegetables and fruit must be seen not only as a source of food and nutrition, but also as a service providing wellness and good health for families. While crops may be sold in the local village or on a nearby market, most crops are sold far from the production sites, in major cities or at faraway markets. This means that produce has to be harvested, sorted, packed, stored and transported to storage facilities or markets, with sales often taking place several days or sometimes weeks after harvesting. Therefore growers, agents, wholesalers and retailers will always be concerned about maintaining quality and minimizing post- harvest losses that may occur in the chain from grower to consumer. Quality of the end product can only occur when there is a realistic, integrated and coordinated linkage between the stages in the supply chain. WHAT IS QUALITY? We all think we know what a quality product is when we see it. In practice, quality always lies in the eyes of the beholder. A quality product for a farmer will be different from a quality product for a retailer, a rich sophisticated housewife or a poor malnourished child. Each has their own perception of quality. Quality GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 530 is sometimes defined as fitness for purpose. Adel Kader and Rosa Rolle (2004) have defined quality as “the degree of excellence or superiority comprising a combination of attributes, properties or characteristics that give each product value in relation to its intended use”. Herein, quality is defined according to particular market or country grade standards. Thus, external attributes such as size, weight, colour, shape and freedom from physical, physiological and pathological defects are key factors, as are internal attributes, such as texture, taste, aroma and chemical composition (nutritional and health-conferring compounds) that are very difficult to measure objectively and non-destructively. The extent to which these dominate depends on the nature of the market. However, it is the end-user who ultimately decides on quality; if they purchase a product, then its perceived (often external) quality satisfies them at the time. If the internal quality of the product is unsatisfactory when consumed, then it will not be purchased again on the next visit to the retailer. The challenge faced by producers is to provide consistent quality such that the consumer is entirely satisfied and makes repeat purchases of that farmer’s product or brand. In general, consumers judge quality and choose to buy on the basis of the appearance of the product, while subsequent purchases are based on their satisfaction with the internal attributes of the product, such as flavour and texture. In other words, they buy using their eyes and their memory. The most important quality attributes influencing consumer choices include: • external features – appearance, size, shape, colour, gloss, firmness, freshness; • internal features – texture, crispness, juiciness, mealiness, toughness, composition, nutritional and health value; • flavour – sweetness, sourness (acidity), aroma, taste, astringency, bitterness, off-flavours; • nutritional value – vitamins (C, A, B, thiamine, niacin), minerals, dietary fibre, antioxidants and phytonutrients (e.g. carotenoids, flavonoids, isoflavones and phytosterols); • freedom from defects – physical damage (cuts, bruises, scars, scabs, russetting), rotting, insect and disease damage; • safe food – freedom from toxins and contaminants, human pathogens (e.g. Salmonella, Listeria and E. Coli) and chemical residues. PRE-HARVEST FACTORS AFFECTING PRODUCT QUALITY Quality at harvest is influenced by a range of pre-harvest factors, including: original planting material, growing conditions, substrate type, nutrient and pest and disease management, and temperature, water and light intensity experienced during plant growth and development. For example, vitamin C is an essential nutrient for humans and comes from fruit and vegetables; its concentration can increase with high light intensity and slight water stress during leaf growth, but 18.", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Harvest and post-harvest management 531 decrease with high nitrogen levels in the growing media (Lee and Kader, 2000). Pre- harvest factors can affect product quality during post-harvest storage. If quality at harvest is not optimum, post-harvest quality and shelf-life are compromised. A problem with tomatoes and sweet peppers is the physiological disorder, blossom end rot, caused by an interaction of low calcium, high nitrogen and fluctuating water availability during growth. A judicious programme is required to optimize calcium and nitrogen nutrition while applying a management system for consistent water availability and good relative humidity control in greenhouses. Foliar applications of appropriate Ca2+ salts may help reduce the disorder as part of a programme to obtain optimum Ca2+ : N ratios in susceptible plants. HARVEST Product quality at harvest time is essential for satisfying subsequent consumer requirements and stimulating repeat purchases. Harvesting stage influences the concentration in micronutrients since many of them (especially carotenoids) accumulate during the whole development process in fruits. For most products optimum quality is attained at harvest time; deterioration then commences and continues inexorably, with quality decreasing through senescence and death. Harvest maturity Depending on the intended market there is an optimum stage of maturity for harvesting, specific for each crop and sometimes for varieties within a crop. If harvested when too immature, the product will never attain its full flavour and aroma potential because of low concentrations of sugars and other compounds that increase with maturity; it will be susceptible to mechanical injury, wilting and physiological disorders including chilling injury. If harvested when overmature, the product will senesce rapidly, be soft and mealy with an insipid flavour, be susceptible to post-harvest pathogens, physical damage and loss of desirable texture, and develop bitter off-flavours. Market forces may influence the time of harvest, with undue and unreasonable pressure brought onto growers by supermarkets to provide a product in times of short supply, even though inherent quality may not be optimal. Care must be taken to ensure that long-term market prospects are not jeopardized by supplying immature products that will have a negative effect on ongoing consumer purchases. With most crops, fruits generally ripen sequentially up the plant; multiple harvests ensure that fruit of uniform and optimum maturity is harvested at any one time, facilitating regular and continuous supplies to market. In general, products should be harvested in the early morning while temperatures are still relatively cool. Peppers, melons, tomatoes and cucumbers should be cut from the plant with sharp scissors or a knife. Care must be taken to avoid physically damaging products during harvest operations or in the containers used to transport them to the packing facility. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 532 Bell pepper (Capsicum) Bell peppers are normally harvested when they have achieved full size and the cultivar’s characteristic colours: green, yellow, purple or red (Figure 1). Market requirements dictate at what colour stage fruit is harvested. Fruit must be of uniform shape and free from defects, such as blossom end rot, cracks, decay or sunburn. Tomato Tomato is a climacteric fruit and can ripen satisfactorily when harvested at the mature green or breaker stages (Figure 2), although it will never attain the sweetness or flavour of fruit harvested at the light red or red stages, as it has not been able to accumulate as much carbohydrate from photosynthesis as has more mature fruit that has spent longer on the vine. The final decision as to the stage of maturity appropriate for harvesting depends on the market location. The closer the market is to the site of production, the more mature the fruit may be. The corollary is that fruit destined for export to a distant market must be harvested at a less mature stage. In many countries, fruits harvested at the mature green or breaker stages are treated subsequently with ethylene (100 ppm, at ~20 °C, 90–95% RH, for 24–72", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Fruit harvested at stages 5 or 6 has enhanced taste and flavour compared with early harvested fruit, but also reduced shelf-life, softening more quickly and being more susceptible to physical handling, transport damage and rots. Fruit can be harvested once seeds are fully developed and gel formation is apparent in at least one locule. It should be noted that any modern long-life varieties with extended shelf-life traits, resulting from the presence of the rin FIGURE 1 Maturity and ripeness stages of bell pepper [Capsicum] UC Davis, 2011 FIGURE 2 Maturity and ripeness stages of tomato 1.

Increasingly diverse offerings are being made available; they generally add value for the grower and provide more convenience for the consumer. Tomato trusses are increasingly used (Plate 1), often in their own convenient package. A number of varieties are now available that mature and ripen relatively evenly along the truss and have a relatively long shelf-life. This means that they can be harvested at a more mature stage than traditional varieties, have higher nutritional value and higher dry matter content, and thus have enhanced taste and flavour and are consequently more likely to be favoured by consumers in repeat purchases. Value can also be added by diversifying packaging. Cucumber Cucumbers are harvested as a physiologically immature but edible fruit, near full size and before the seeds are full size or hard. Fruits are edible at most developmental stages. At optimal harvest maturity, a jelly-like material forms in the seed cavity. Firmness and glossiness also indicate imminent harvest maturity. Fruit should be uniform in shape and size, firm with a dark green colour, free from defects and no signs of yellowing should be visible (Figure 3). Green bean Green beans are immature fruit vegetables, harvested while still developing and growing rapidly, when the fruit is bright green, the pod is fleshy and seeds are small and green. They should be well- formed, straight, fresh in appearance, tender but firm, and should snap easily when bent. Pods should be smooth and without bulges from the seeds inside. Eggplant (aubergine) Eggplant fruits are harvested at a range of developmental stages depending on the cultivar (Plate 2), but generally when Plate 1 Tomato fruit trusses where fruit is of uniform size and colour FIGURE 3 Chart for assessing cucumber maturity UC Davis, 2011 Plate 2 Range of egglant types GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 534 immature, before seeds enlarge and harden. Normal quality indices apply, such as size, characteristic shape, skin colour, freedom from defects and presence of a fresh green calyx. Melon There are many melon cultivars, some of local origin and grown traditionally; each have their own specific maturity attributes and are not normally harvested according to size (Figures 4 and 5). As with other fruits, harvesting at the correct stage of maturation is important to allow them to store and retain eating quality right through to the final consumer. Some important types grown in Mediterranean countries include: ‘Cantaloupe’, ‘Galia’, ‘Charentais’, FIGURE 4 ‘Cantaloupe’ melon: fully ripe melon UC Davis, 2011", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Harvest and post-harvest management 535 ‘Crenshaw’ and ‘Honeydew’. ‘Cantaloupe’ fruits are harvested at ¾ to full slip when a definite abscission zone (“slip”) has developed. Fruit should be firm with a raised and well-formed netting on the surface. Depending on the cultivar, skin colour varies from dull green to deep green at maturity and light yellow at ripeness. Harvest maturity is difficult to assess on honeydew melons as no clear abscission zone forms. Maturity is normally judged by changes in ground colour from green to cream. Lettuce Lettuce in greenhouses will generally be produced hydroponically using specialized high value cultivars of varied colour, size and degree of heart formation. In most cases they will tend to consist of loose leaves rather than a firm or hard head; in other words they will be less developed than the traditional crisp or ‘Iceberg’ types. Such less developed lettuce plants will have better flavour than overmature heads that will tend to be bitter and less sweet. In many cases, lettuce will be harvested when leaves are the typical colour for the cultivar, not wilted and free from defects such as tip burn. Whole plants can be harvested with intact roots (Plate 3) and placed in plastic bags or containers, so they remain “alive” through the supply chain until they reach the home of the consumer. It is important for growers to determine the market requirements of size, colour, type and optimum production time in order to optimize sales and profitability. In addition, a large proportion of lettuce is destined for the restaurant trade and is prepared as “fresh cut” or loose leaves in polymeric film packages. Harvesting operations While harvesting is dependent on planting dates and environmental conditions during growth, the harvesting operation must nevertheless be well planned and coordinated with a comprehensive packaging, storage and marketing strategy organized well before harvesting commences. Staff must be well trained to consistently harvest only those products at the correct stage of maturity for the intended market. Staff must adopt good hygienic practices with clean hands, removal of rings, and short fingernails to avoid making cuts in the product while harvesting. All products must be handled gently to avoid surface damage. Tools for harvesting must be clean, sharp and well maintained to minimize injury. Cutting implements (knives, scissors, secateurs) should be rinsed regularly in disinfectant solution to avoid cross contamination of any diseases. Plate 3 Lettuces growing hydroponically (left); harvested with roots attched (right) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 536 Harvesting should be done early in the morning to reduce the field heat load of the crop. At this time fruit will be fully turgid having accumulated water during the night and can be very susceptible to mechanical damage if not handled very gently during harvesting and transport to the packhouse. Most crops need to be harvested on more than one occasion as the fruits attain the appropriate maturity. Once harvested, products should be shaded from direct sunlight to prevent heating from direct radiation and respiration heat, both of which hasten deterioration. Time between harvest and initial cooling must be minimal, as greenhouse crops are very perishable, and respire and transpire at high rates at normal greenhouse temperatures.

All products must be harvested carefully and placed gently into appropriate containers to avoid any physical damage (bruises, cuts) that may lead to increased loss of water and vitamin C. Any vertical drop of more than 25 cm will result in bruising for most perishable greenhouse crops. Physical damage leads to production of ethylene in some crops, entry of post-harvest pathogens and increased susceptibility to post-harvest rots. Containers must not be too deep to avoid compression damage of soft products, and they should have smooth sides, no sharp edges, and must be kept clean and sanitized prior to reuse to prevent development and spread of disease organisms. Mechanization is being increasingly developed in harvesting aids. A recent innovation is the production of a new container for capsicums with an automatically movable bottom plate that sinks into the container as more capsicums are added to the top of the container. Each container has two sections, is 2.5 m in length and can hold about 300 kg of fruit (Plate 4). Other automated or semi-automated systems exist for different greenhouse configurations and crops (e.g. overhead moving conveying systems). As soon as containers are full, they should be immediately removed from the greenhouse and taken to the sorting and packing zone of the complex. They must be removed from the heat of the greenhouse and direct sunlight to a zone where the product (field) heat can be removed quickly. Some products, including tomatoes, peppers and aubergines, may be packed directly into their final containers in the greenhouse, but this depends on the product type, the uniformity of the product and the nature of the intended market. Plate 4 A new “automatic” harvest container developed by Buitendijk Slaman BV for capsicums and other greenhouse crops 18. Harvest and post-harvest management 537 TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT The quality of greenhouse-grown crops is dictated by two main factors: • physical damage sustained during harvesting and transport; and • temperature management. The best way to maintain post-harvest quality and reduce deterioration is to reduce product temperatures to levels that are optimal for the specific crop. There are two separate sides to temperature management (Thompson, 2004): • precooling to remove field heat and reduce product temperature as quickly as possible after harvest; and • storage to maintain products at an optimum temperature during accumulation of loads and during transport and distribution to markets. Reducing temperature decreases product metabolic activity, reduces ethylene production and action, and slows ripening, decay development, wilting and hence rate of deterioration. Different crops can be cooled using different methods (their effectiveness is compared in Table 1). However, for most common greenhouse crops, forced air cooling is probably the most useful and cost-effective. Precooling Products should be placed in a cool shaded place as soon as possible after harvest; if left exposed to the sun, product temperature will increase rapidly and deterioration will accelerate. The best practice is to remove field heat as soon as is practicable after harvest or packing; this is generally undertaken in a precooling facility. Precooling can be achieved using several different systems, some preferable for specific products. Harvesting – Summary and GAP recommendations • Maturity at harvest must be such that the product reaches the consumer at optimum eating quality. • Harvesting too soon results in susceptibility to decay, water loss and lack of sugars. • Harvesting too late results in premature senescence, susceptibility to decay and over-ripe product with decreasing taste, flavour and texture. • Each product has its own optimum harvest maturity depending on the location and on the distance and transport time from the production site. • Great care must be taken to avoid physical damage to products during harvest and transport to the packing facility, as cuts, bruises and scarring will lead to pathogen infection. • Tools used for harvesting must be clean, sharp and sanitized regularly.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 538 Passive (room) cooling The most common method, a normal coolstore is used with no special alterations. The product (in various types of containers) is exposed to cold air with a minimum velocity of 60 m/min and cooled by a combination of conductive and evaporative cooling, but the process is slow and not recommended for rapid removal of field heat. Products are cooled and stored in the same coolstore. This system is relatively inefficient compared with others available, but it is ideal for longer-term storage if required. Forced air (or pressure) cooling Much faster than normal room cooling, cold air in a coolstore is forced through produce packed in boxes or pallet bins. A number of airflow systems are used, but the tunnel cooler is the most common. Two rows of products in packages or bins or on pallets are stacked on either side of an air-return channel. A tarpaulin or strong plastic sheet is placed over the product and the channel, creating a small difference and thus drawing air through the product. The product is cooled in batches and cooling times range from 1 hour for cut flowers to more than 6–8 hours for larger, solid fruit and vegetables. Temperature reduction is less marked in products packed with airflow-restricting materials such as polyethylene (PE) bags or paper wraps. Forced air cooling has several advantages over passive cooling: • The product remains for a shorter time at field or elevated temperatures. • Cooling times are short and cooling units are efficient. • Products are cooled in a variety of containers without wetting or excessive handling, provided adequate ventilation openings are present. • For large volumes requiring cooling, energy-efficiency is increased.

Kitinoja and Thompson, 2010 18. Harvest and post-harvest management 539 • Available coolstores can be easily converted to forced air cooling with only a small investment in fans, provided that they are of adequate size and cooling capacity is available. Mobile precooling units have been developed for farmers with small properties and no access to expensive packing facilities. These mobile units vary in size and capacity and can be moved or relocated in different production areas as required. All products cool rapidly at first then more slowly with time. Regardless of the starting temperature of the product, the shape of the product temperature curve remains the same for a given product type; packing density; container type, orientation and ventilation; volume-to-surface ratio of product; airflow capacity and distance travelled by cooling air. The 7/8 cooling time is an industry standard describing the time required to remove 87.5 percent of the temperature difference between the product starting temperature and the temperature of the cooling air (Figure 6). Cooling should commence as soon as possible after harvest, preferably within one hour. Product temperature should be recorded before and after precooling to ensure system efficiency. The cooling rate is related to three key factors: • length of time in the precooler sufficient to reach the desired temperature; • maintenance of constant cooling air temperature; and • free circulation of cooling air over all product surfaces (containers must have adequate ventilation holes and be correctly aligned on pallets).

Care must be taken to ensure that weight loss is minimized during the cooling process by maintaining relatively high humidity in the cooling room. Vacuum cooling This method is suitable for selected leafy crops with a high surface to volume ratio, such as lettuce, spinach, herbs and celery. It is a very fast cooling method that relies on evaporation from throughout the product; the energy for water evaporation is obtained from the field heat of the crop. Approximately 0.2 g of water are lost from every kilogram of product for each 1 °C of cooling; therefore, the product is thoroughly wetted prior to sealing in the vacuum chamber, and the process of pressure reduction is carefully controlled to ensure that the product does not go below its freezing point. For products that lose water easily (e.g. leafy vegetables), FIGURE 6 Typical time-temperature relationship for forced air cooling of produce 32 16 4 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 1/2 cooling time Cooling time (hours) Produce strarts at 32 °Celsius, cooled using 0 °Celcius air 7/8 cooling time Temperature of produce (°Celcius) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 540 adequate cooling takes 20–30 minutes, even when wrapped in film. Vacuum cooling is common practice in some countries for cooling lettuce; however, the equipment is expensive to purchase and operate, therefore, it is mainly used in large volume systems or in a cooperative manner among several producers. Hydrocooling This method uses cold water to remove field heat at a rate faster than forced air cooling, and it does not remove water from the product in the process. It is used for a number of fruit and vegetable crops, including asparagus, peas, beans, cucumbers and courgettes. Hydrocooling is most efficient when individual products are completely covered with cold water, either by total immersion or thorough drenching; the process is less efficient with palletized loads, especially in closed containers. Careful operational management is essential to achieve thorough cooling; this is done by constant monitoring of both water and product temperatures, adjusting the product exposure time as required. Water must be clean (of potable standard) and sanitized (usually with chlorine) to prevent buildup of dirt and pathogenic microbes; it should be changed frequently. Packages used in hydrocooling must allow movement of water across the product while being robust enough to withstand prolonged wetting; plastic or wood containers are quite suitable for hydrocooling. Ice cooling Crushed or flaked ice is commonly used to cool leafy crops, broccoli, green onions, sweet corn and musk melons. Melting ice absorbs heat energy and thus cools the product quickly, minimizing moisture loss. Crushed ice or ice slurry is sprayed on top of produce in individual (polystyrene or plastic) or palletized containers before or during transport. While this method of cooling is used commercially, it is not generally recommended because it is unnecessary, expensive and has the potential to increase rot development during storage and transit because of the extended exposure to liquid water as ice melts. Cooling – GAP recommendations • Harvest should take place in the early morning hours and not during times of high temperature. • Harvested products must be removed from direct sunlight, preferably into shade. • The packhouse should be cooled, or at least with good ventilation. • Different technologies are available for rapid cooling after harvest. • Forced air cooling is suitable for many products. • Hydro- and vacuum cooling are appropriate for some leafy vegetables including lettuce. • Chilling temperatures are to be avoided. • Mobile units are available for forced air and hydrocooling systems. 18. Harvest and post-harvest management 541 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND TEMPERATURE All greenhouse crops should be cooled to their recommended temperature as soon as possible after harvest (Table 2). Each crop has a different optimum temperature for maintenance of post-harvest quality and reduction of deterioration rate.

Harvest and post-harvest management 541 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND TEMPERATURE All greenhouse crops should be cooled to their recommended temperature as soon as possible after harvest (Table 2). Each crop has a different optimum temperature for maintenance of post-harvest quality and reduction of deterioration rate. In general, relative humidity in cool stores should be over 90 percent to minimize water loss from products. Most vegetable crops have little or only moderate benefits from storage in modified (MA) or controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions (2–5% oxygen and 2–10% carbon dioxide depending on crop – see Table 3).

Chilling injury With the exception of lettuce, all of the crops considered in this chapter are susceptible to chilling injury (CI). Chilling injury is the manifestation of physiological damage that occurs when certain fruits and vegetables are exposed to low, but not freezing, temperatures that disrupt the normal metabolism, causing damage to cell membranes, eventually visible as a range of visual disorders including: pitting, browning, sunken skin tissue, water-soaked lesions, discoloration, premature and uneven softening, skin russetting, poor and uneven coloration, and ultimately decay by invading normally non-pathogenic fungi. Development of CI is related to the critical temperature of each product and is a function of both time and temperature. The lower the temperature and the longer the time below a threshold, the faster the development of CI. Therefore products must always be stored at temperatures above the chilling temperature throughout the supply chain. Generally symptoms of chilling injury only appear following removal to ambient temperatures (Plate 5). COOLSTORE DESIGN Experienced professional engineering companies with extensive experience in fruit storage systems should be used to design and erect coolstores for greenhouse crops that are highly perishable and subject to chilling injury. Too often, companies involved in building cooling systems in commercial buildings or for coldstores for frozen (dead) products are used, with potentially serious negative consequences for products that only require chilling temperatures above 0 °C or between 5 and 14 °C.

Harvest and post-harvest management 543 Coolstores should be purpose-built for specific operations. Size and capacity depend on volume and product type. Provisions should be made at the design stage to create an energy-efficient system using available technologies. Only approved refrigerants should be used. Coolstores should be constructed on a concrete base (preferably insulated), using prefabricated insulated panels, with a water vapour barrier included in the floor and walls to prevent inward and outward movement of moisture. For controlled atmospheres, rooms must be designed to be gas-tight with appropriate automatic pressure relief valves to compensate for atmospheric pressure changes. Doors must also be insulated, close fitting, and with a plastic or air curtain to minimize air movement in and out during loading and unloading. Refrigeration systems must be able to cope with predetermined peak loadings and also with any precooling loads that may be imposed on the system. Positioning and capacity of the fans and evaporators is critically important to ensure that airflow within a fully loaded room is adequate to reduce and maintain product temperatures. It is highly recommended that coolstore design criteria: • ensure that appropriate refrigeration capacity is available for any rooms that will be used for forced air cooling; • specify requirements for high relative humidity conditions (> 90%) needed for perishable greenhouse products (modern evaporator design enables such high relative humidity to be maintained during operation); • allow even airflow through packed products when cool rooms are full; and • include systems enabling fluent and efficient stacking of pallets and movement of forklifts within stores. All coolstores must be monitored using sensors linked to computer systems with automatic alarm and communication links to the coolstore manager for eventual problems. Temperatures should be monitored continuously at several points within the cool room. Both return and delivery air from each evaporator, as well as temperatures from several locations within the room, must be recorded, as should flesh temperatures of products located in different parts of the storage room. Simply relying on a wall-sited temperature gauge outside the room is totally inappropriate for monitoring product or air temperatures. Increasingly, coolstores are fitted with radio frequency identification (RFID) units to track the location and movement of fruit placed in the cool room. This facilitates operation, ensures that pallets of products with certain attributes (e.g. size, colour) required for specific markets can be located and removed without delay (generally on a first in, first out basis). Cool rooms should open into a temperature- controlled plenum in which pallets can be accumulated and stored for short periods prior to loading into refrigerated trucks/containers. Products should be loaded directly from the docking bay in the plenum onto the truck to maintain product temperature and to reduce hot air ingress into the truck and plenum (Plate 6). GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 544 MINIMIZING MOISTURE LOSS FROM PRODUCTS As vegetable products comprise 90–95 percent water, and this content constitutes most of the saleable value, it is essential to adopt protocols to reduce post-harvest water loss to a minimum. Retention of moisture is very important for maintaining quality attributes, including texture, firmness and crispness. Once harvested, any water lost by the product through evaporation cannot be replaced by the plant root and stem system and therefore net water loss occurs mainly via evaporation through stomata on the leaves and lenticels on the fruit. Rupture of the product surface, caused by physical handling damage, also exacerbates water loss. The rate of water loss is dependent on the relative humidity (RH) of the surrounding air; low RH will cause more water to be lost than high RH. Coolstore – GAP recommendations • Coolstores should be located at the end of the packing shed to suit product flow and facilitate loading onto transporters. • Coolstores should have insulated concrete floors and walls. • Temperature monitoring of both air and product should be undertaken in several locations in each coolstore to ensure that minimum and maximum checkpoints are not exceeded. • Computer-controlled monitoring should be used, including automatic alarm to operator in case of emergencies • High relative humidity can be achieved by minimizing temperature drop with evaporators. • Only approved refrigerants may be used. • Temperatures", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Harvest and post-harvest management 545 Post-harvest moisture loss during storage can be minimized when the refrigeration system is designed in an appropriate manner. Minimizing the temperature difference across evaporators can result in relatively high RH within coolstores. In addition moisture loss is reduced when products are packed in containers lined with polymeric films. ETHYLENE Ethylene is a naturally occurring gas produced by all living organisms and it is both beneficial and detrimental to plants. Ethylene is particularly important in horticulture: on the positive side, it induces and modulates ripening in many crops; from a negative perspective, it induces premature ripening, stimulates senescence and speeds up post-harvest product deterioration. Fruit may be climacteric or non-climacteric. Climacteric fruit are those where a sharp increase in ethylene production occurs at the onset of ripening, a process which is thought to control initiation of changes in colour, aroma, taste, flavour, firmness, texture and other physiological processes, including the production of more ethylene. Climacteric fruit will ripen after harvest. In contrast, ripening of non-climacteric fruit occurs largely via an ethylene-independent process, the nature of which is currently under intense research. Non-climacteric fruit are ripe and ready to eat at harvest. Climacteric fruit are variously sensitive to exogenous ethylene in the preclimacteric stage, and can produce large amounts of ethylene during ripening. Ethylene also comes from human-induced sources, in particular pollution caused by fuels burning in internal combustion engines (tractors, trucks, engine- driven forklifts), as well as decaying and senescing vegetation and plant products. Contamination of greenhouses by combustion products from gas-fired heaters has been known to induce abscission of flowers and fruit within the house; electric forklifts must be used in packhouses and coolstores to avoid contamination with ethylene produced by petrol-driven forklifts. Ethylene can have negative affects at very low concentrations. In some fruit a concentration of < 0.03 ppm is enough to initiate premature senescence. Table 4 shows that production of, and sensitivity to exogenous ethylene varies depending on product type and cultivar of the same genus. Ethylene is used to ripen tomatoes. Fruit harvested at mature green can be ripened by exposure to 100 ppm ethylene at 13–20 °C for 24–72 hours. Air circulation must ensure that temperature uniformity is achieved with specially designed ripening rooms. Such treatments can facilitate managed marketing. Ethylene appears to have no effect on ripening of capsicum. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 546 1-Methylcyclopropene [MCP] A major advance in reducing the action of ethylene has been in the use of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP; SmartfreshSM). This chemical, that works as a gas released in a controlled manner into airtight storage rooms, has been approved for use on several fruit crops in a number of countries. It inhibits ethylene action and in doing so prevents autocatalytic ethylene biosynthesis. SmartfreshSM is approved for use in some countries on tomatoes and melons. For tomato, post-harvest application of 0.5–1.0 µl per litre 1-MCP for 24 hours delayed or inhibited quality deterioration and extended shelf-life of several tomato cultivars whilst maintaining organoleptic quality. Similarly SmartFreshSM is registered for use on melons in some countries and can be used to slow down senescence and maintain quality during extended storage. New formulations of 1-MCP (including HarvistaTM) are being developed for use as pre-harvest sprays for horticultural crops, but are generally not yet available for commercial use. SmartFreshSM is registered in some countries for use on vegetables and herbs", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Its main effect is to decrease the rate of ethylene-induced senescence, resulting in: reduced yellowing of leaves (beans and broccoli), fewer disorders (browning and russet spotting of lettuce), extended shelf-life (cucumber), reduction in softening and delay in colour change (tomato), and reduced shatter with abscissions (bunched cherry tomato). Treatments to reduce deleterious effects of ethylene A number of practices can reduce the negative effects of exposure to ethylene: • Avoid exposure to environmental pollution with varying amounts of ethylene (e.g. do not locate packing houses or coolstores downwind of busy roads).

UC Davis, 2011 (adapted) 18. Harvest and post-harvest management 547 • Avoid physical, physiological and pathogen damage to products during harvesting, handling, packing, storage and transport; physically damaged or decaying goods produce ethylene. • Remove all reject products from packhouses and coolstores. • Use electric forklifts in packhouses and coolstores, as internal combustion engines burning petrol, diesel or gas produce ethylene. • If necessary, use ethylene scrubbers (e.g. potassium permanganate or activated charcoal) in coolstores to reduce ethylene concentrations. • Ensure that coolstores run efficiently, maintaining recommended temperatures that will minimize ethylene production by products. • If permitted and required, treat with SmartFreshSM. • Use long-life cultivars, if available, with reduced susceptibility to ethylene; this is possible with tomatoes. SORTING AND GRADING After harvest, fruit has to be sorted and graded to meet specific quality, market and export phytosanitary standards. Growers and all staff involved in the operation must be aware of specific market requirements. The packhouse and associated coolstore(s) should be near to but separate from the greenhouse. They should be sited far from or downwind of main roads to minimize exposure to ethylene pollution from internal combustion engines. A covered area for receiving and accumulating produce is essential for protection from exposure to direct sunlight. All reject products should be removed from the packhouse as they are a potential source of post-harvest pathogen inoculum and subsequent ethylene production. In countries with high ambient temperatures, packhouses should have a cooling system both for the comfort of staff and to reduce the tendency of produce to heat post-harvest. Management tools available to minimize exposure of products to ethylene • Locate growing facilities, packhouse and coolstore upwind of major roads or pollution sources from which ethylene may flow. • Situate truck loading facilities on the downwind side of packing and storage facilities. • Use electric forklifts in and around such facilities. • Prohibit smoking in and around the facilities. • Instantly remove any senescent or rotting product from the site. • Within coolstores, use activated charcoal or other scrubbers that remove ethylene from the air stream; they can be incorporated into the store design. • If registered, use 1-MCP as a means of preventing ethylene action. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 548 To enhance efficiency, a packhouse must be well designed to facilitate flow from the harvested product at one end through to coolstores and loading outlets at the other.

There must be adequate space to contain packing line(s) (with room for future expansion) for washing, sizing, sorting, segregating, sanitizing, waxing, packing and accumulation of produce. Space must be made available for (temporary) storage of excess products out of the sun, as well as conveyors, packing materials, labels and pallets. In addition, a centralized computer control room should be in a central and elevated position so that operators can view all aspects of the system easily. A separate space is required for the quality assurance team, an integral part of any modern packing and marketing operation. In some large operations it may be desirable to have a laboratory where physical and chemical analyses can be undertaken. During unloading, care must be taken to avoid causing mechanical damage. Products are taken from the containers into which the crop was harvested in the greenhouse, and placed on sorting tables where products can be segregated according to a range of attributes as specified for selected markets. As consumers become increasingly demanding in terms of the quality of produce that they purchase, uniformity and quality in the product lines are expected. There are many different types of grading and sizing systems available today. The choice of which system to use depends on the product, the volume to be handled, and the degree of segregation required, which in turn depends on the number and type of markets supplied. Such systems can range from simple hand sorting and packing to highly sophisticated computer controlled integrated systems with minimal labour requirements. Where computer controlled systems are not used, lighting and ergonomic design must be optimal for the most labour- intensive part of the sorting and packing operations. Staff must be able to view each product unit as it passes along the sorting table situated at a height that minimizes reaching and lifting. Space must be provided for stools, and ear protection for staff to minimize noise fatigue. Good agricultural practice management should ensure that the speed of produce movement is appropriate for the quality level of any line: the more variable the product quality, the slower the line. Adjustment of the bin dump rate is an efficient way of ensuring optimum efficiency and accuracy of sorting at a rate consistent with the overall quality of each product line. Sorting and segregating staff must be well trained, and consistency of quality for minimum acceptability and criteria for rejection agreed and implemented by all team members. Staff should have specific responsibilities, with experienced workers located downstream of less experienced workers. Staff rotation is important to avoid tiredness and reduced worker efficiency. Computer-controlled sorting systems can segregate for weight, colour, blemish, diameter, shape, density and internal taste. 18. Harvest and post-harvest management 549 Current models comprise fully integrated systems comprising: sophisticated size and segregating control systems, peripheral bin dumps, water flumes, a range of packing options, labelling facilities with full traceability capability, and automatic pallet stacking and wrapping. High speed cameras and near infrared spectroscopy systems are used operating at speeds of 12–15 fruit per second on a single lane. Modern packing lines are reasonably well designed to minimize both number and extent of drops at points of transfer or direction change. However it is essential to undertake regular inspections and ensure that all surfaces at such drops or transfer points are well padded with energy-absorbent material to reduce mechanical damage. POST-HARVEST PATHOGENS AND DECAY All fresh vegetables are very perishable and susceptible to infection by a number of post-harvest pathogens. Although most products are resistant to most pathogens, certain specialized pathogens cause substantial financial losses. Infection occurs when the spores of fungi or bacteria grow on and penetrate wounded or stressed tissue. Most losses are caused by organisms infecting produce that has: • been under stress during the growing season; • suffered physical damage during harvest and handling; • been stored too long after harvest; or • sustained chilling injury.

Such chemicals must be registered for use in both the country of production and the country where the product is to be marketed. Physical damage creates avenues through which it is possible for fungal and bacterial pathogens to enter the fruit and cause infection resulting in serious economic losses (Plates 7, 8 and 9). In some cases physiological disorders (e.g. blossom end rot) can lead to infection.

Harvest and post-harvest management 551 SANITATION AND FOOD SAFETY Today’s consumers are preoccupied with food safety. Quality assurance systems exist to ensure food safety: a factor critical for sustained marketing success. It is imperative that measures are implemented to minimize the risk of contamination from human pathogens and reduce the risk of post-harvest decay from fungal and bacterial pathogens. Appropriate phytosanitary processes must be implemented in all post-harvest facilities and operations, and approved by appropriate auditors as required by local, national and marketing authorities. Sanitation is generally regarded as an integral part of any hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) system applied in the greenhouse, packing house, grading machinery, coolstores, transport vehicles, distribution centres and markets. A number of sanitizing agents are approved for use on fresh products, but must be approved by local authorities and the market (Table 5). New systems are becoming available that involve strict monitoring and control of the cool chain (from packhouse to market). They are used for an increasing range of horticultural products in intercontinental sea freight. In one system, controlled release and monitoring of ozone is used to reduce pathogens and to minimize ethylene action, thus reducing the rate of deterioration, enhancing quality at wholesale and retail markets, and increasing profitability for all those in the supply chain.

Sargent et al., 2007 GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 552 QUALITY AND MARKET STANDARDS Individual countries are likely to have their own domestic quality or marketing standards for fruit and vegetables and these may vary from one country to another. It is important that producers understand and adhere to these standards. Apart from the general guidelines outlined by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, export destinations have specific requirements for food quality and safety that must be met by suppliers. Entry to export markets may be refused if such quality and safety standards are not met. The European Union (EU) has specific and wide-ranging quality and marketing regulations. For example, Marketing Standards for Fruit and Vegetables Commission Regulation (EU) No. 543/20111 builds on Council Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2007 that states that “all fruit and vegetables should comply with the general marketing standard (sound, fair and marketable quality) and indicate the country of origin. The latter must be in a language understandable by the Cleaning and sanitation – GAP recommendations • Clean produce with potable water or treat with 100–200 ppm of free (available) chlorine at a pH of 6.8–7.2 in recirculating water; this can be done by dipping, drenching or spraying. • Provide chlorine as sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite or liquid chlorine; other chemicals that may be used under specific conditions include chlorine gas, chlorine dioxide gas and ozone, but these can be toxic to humans and need handling with great care (Table 5). • Maintain pH at 6.8–7.2: pH > 8.0 is less effective and pH < 6.5 becomes too corrosive for equipment and product (Figure 7). • Adopt appropriate methods (automated/ manual) to regularly and accurately measure free chlorine concentrations and pH of water. • Maintain water temperature of the chlorinated solution at ~5 °C above pulp temperature of product. • Change recirculating water daily but ensure that environmental guidelines are followed for disposal of this water. • Remove surplus surface moisture by vibration or airflow.

Consumers want products that are free of visual defects, visually attractive, tasty with pleasing texture, free of contaminants and preferably endowed with health benefits. Proverbs such as “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” have strong roots in traditional health cures used by our ancestors. Moreover, an increasing number of consumers want products obtained from environmentally friendly, sustainable and ethical production and post-harvest systems. The market niche for organically produced fruit and vegetables, while still modest, has increased in recent years, although it is mainly limited to consumers with higher incomes, since these products are often sold at a higher prices. Some consumers expect products to originate from specific geographic areas that have soil, climate and cultural characteristics that contribute to a unique product flavour and quality. For growers who are market-oriented and keen to differentiate their products based on the region in which they are grown, developing the capacity to meet high quality standards while following such trends can represent a major challenge. European texts containing guidelines for labelling products “Protected Geographical Indication” (CE No. 510/2006) or “organic” (CE No. 889/2008) are essential reading for growers wishing to target these market sectors. All growers strive to gain and increase market acceptance and market share, achieved by the consistent production of high quality products over several years. Buyers become aware of quality growers and seek to purchase their products at premium prices. To enhance their position, growers should therefore create a brand or label identifying them to the market and guarantee continued supply in terms of quantity and quality to maintain their reputation. Labels and brands should be created to establish production location and details of product size, and a barcode should contain this information with traceability. Recent developments with the quick response (QR) code are likely to have impacts in product advertising and marketing. The QR code is a cell phone readable barcode that can store Web site URLs, plain text, phone numbers, email addresses and other alphanumeric data (Figure 8). This technology has become a focus of advertising strategy, since 2 Available at: http://www.freshquality.eu/php/category.php?cat_id=115. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 554 it gives consumers quick and effortless access to the brand or grower Web site that contains pertinent information about both the grower and the production site. GLOBALG.A.P . REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD SAFETY In response to widespread consumer demand, major supermarket chains around the world require growers to provide food that is safe to eat, produced in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. While different supermarkets have established different systems, they can all be satisfied if growers and produce handlers use the well-established protocols outlined in the GLOBALG.A.P. manifest. GLOBALG.A.P. is a private sector organization that has established voluntary standards for certifying production processes of agricultural and horticultural products internationally. It provides a practical manual for good agricultural practices anywhere in the world (http://www. globalgap.org ).3 QUALITY CONTROL PROCESSES With increased globalization of trade, and the associated movement of fresh vegetables across national borders, it is critically important that growers recognize and adhere to both phytosanitary and quality standards in different countries and markets. In general, government action is limited to ensuring pest and disease status of produce destined for export, responsible for providing inspection services and issuing the phytosanitary certificates required by importing countries. Grade and quality standards are likely to vary between countries, markets and supermarket chains, the latter setting their own quality standards, although adherence to GLOBALG.A.P. standards is almost universally required apart from in unregulated local markets. In addition, statutory (Codex Alimentarius) standards must be attained and maintained and the EU has basic quality requirements that must be met. Well-trained staff should be dedicated to quality control, working to agreed schedules FIGURE 8 A QR code – an increasingly important technology for providing relevant grower and product information for consumers, readable by mobile phone The Codex Alimentarius Commission was created in 1963 by FAO and WHO to develop food standards, guidelines and related texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme.

Harvest and post-harvest management 555 and quality sampling protocols determined by the grower organization to meet specific market and customer requirements. It may be desirable to establish laboratory facilities to monitor: grade standards; quality attributes (including weight, size, colour and freedom from defects); and, as necessary, other intrinsic quality attributes (e.g. dry matter, sugar content and acidity). Residue analysis must be done in a registered/licensed laboratory. PACKAGING Packaging is required to get the product from the production centre to the consumer in the market place. It serves three purposes: • Protection from physical, physiological and pathological damage during handling, storage, distribution and marketing. • Assembly of products in uniform quantities for ease of handling and transport (producing units, such as palletization, may be adopted). • Presentation with containers labelled with a distinctive brand/logo for promotion, information about the grower and specific product traceability including harvest and/or packing date (many containers are specially designed to be the final presentation display in the supermarket and thus contain attractive designs and brands, as well as barcodes indicating prices). Containers may be of many types and materials but must always meet the needs of the buyer and customer (buyers for large supermarkets often condition the type of container used). Furthermore, society is concerned about sustainability and environmental issues and dictates that containers and packages must be recyclable or returnable. At the same time packages must be designed to allow adequate ventilation during cooling and storage as well as being strong enough to withstand the rigours of multiple handlings along the supply chain. A container must be constructed of a material strong enough that the package, and not the product, bears the weight of a stacked pallet, and will not weaken if the pallet gets wet in transit (Plate 10). In general, large retail chains have attempted to standardize package size and shape to reduce waste and associated costs. In some countries, this had led to adoption of fibreboard trays and reusable plastic crates or trays having a “standard footprint” that fully utilizes the standard pallet (Plate 11). Plate 10 Examples of different types and sizes of plastic returnable crates GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 556 Package dimensions are becoming important internationally and size or shape are chosen to increase efficiency in packing, handling and storage; an optimal length-to-width ratio is about 1.5 : 1. International recommendations indicate that maximum pack weights should be about 15–20 kg, able to be moved easily by individuals of both genders, but with many “retail ready” products (retail packs of 2–5 kg single layers are becoming increasingly popular). Unitization refers to the assembling of packages and containers onto pallets; this enhances efficiency in the distribution chain as it enables relatively large numbers of individual containers to be handled mechanically as one unit with appropriate equipment. Attempts have been made internationally to adopt standardized cartons, pallets and shipping containers for fresh produce to optimize stowage efficiency in transport containers. An important characteristic of any package or container is that it must allow rapid and unimpeded air ventilation during cooling and storage; with fibreboard boxes or crates, it is essential to have adequate holes for ventilation while retaining adequate mechanical strength to withstand the weight of all containers on a pallet. Polymeric films, either perforated or not, depending on permeability and the product, can be used with perishable vegetable crops to minimize water loss and, if required, to create modified atmospheres that may slow the deterioration rate. Automation of packing systems is increasingly popular in larger facilities: it reduces labour needs and costs, enhances uniformity and consistency of product sorting, and can if necessary operate 23 hours per day (1 hour set aside", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Potential exists for entire packing lines to be automated, and several international companies provide appropriate equipment to this end for crops such as tomatoes. For most crops it is sensible to strap and wrap pallets to provide stability during transport and distribution to and within markets. In some cases pallets are Plate 11 Examples of different types of packaging used for tomatoes, capsicums and cucumbers 18. Harvest and post-harvest management 557 shrink-wrapped in polymeric films, but this is not recommended where ventilation through the pallet and over the product is required to minimize respiration rate and ethylene production during storage, transport and distribution. TRACEABILITY Logistics systems are in a period of major change, moving from tracking capabilities to tracing throughout the entire supply chain from producer to supermarket. • Tracking is the capacity to follow the path of a specific item through the supply chain as it moves within and between organizations. • Tracing is the capacity to identify the origin of a particular item or batch of produce located at any place and at any time within the supply chain from records held upstream of the original production and packing source. Tracking serves both to get goods to market and to establish that the item reaches the customer on time. Tracing is difficult for most organizations to implement, and complete and verifiable traceability often represents a major challenge. But traceability is the key to risk management, and is increasingly becoming a requirement of modern trade for reasons of biosecurity, food safety, physical security, and brand and market protection. Traceability is an increasingly important commercial issue because of the convergence of five forces: • consumer preferences • retailer profits • wholesaler profits • demands for safety and biosecurity from the health and agriculture authorities • requirements for traceability of the product to its point of origin or contamination (requirements made also by health and agriculture authorities) New technologies offer cost-effective, value-creating traceability solutions: • Electronic product code identification (EPC) and other radio frequency identification (RFID, Figure 9) systems introduced into global logistics chains, spearheaded by Walmart and Tesco among others – these initiatives are designed to secure significant productivity gains and provide customer safety and quality assurance. • More secure logistics systems following security upgrades in the wake of terrorist activity in many countries. • Emerging technologies that assist in traceability and authentication of products and their points of origin. An increasing number of recently developed commercial technologies are in this category as they become cheaper, more precise and accessible; they counteract the rising incidence and business impact of counterfeiting activities within global trade, and the GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 558 increasing access of counterfeit producers to modern production technologies with the globalization of industrial activities. Some existing commercial systems are available and being used for horticulture. One such system uses relatively cheap disposable sensors (located in individual cartons, if necessary) and provides: • continuous quality monitoring without human intervention; • real-time alerts so that corrective or compensative action can be taken before it is too late; • on-the-spot quality reports for informed decision-making; • complete supply chain traceability: in the warehouse, in transit and during post-arrival storage; and • continuous communication with the central control centre. As technology advances, sensors and information systems will be able to handle ever larger amounts of information from an increasing number of environmental signals. RFID components are becoming smaller and more powerful (Plate 12, Figure 9) and small sensors are becoming commercially available that will measure CO2, O2 and ethylene as well as product pulp temperature within loads on a continuous basis. Some companies offer services to install systems that will generate information along international supply chains and claim to have significantly reduced post-harvest losses (and hence increased profits) by ensuring that storage conditions along the entire chain are optimized.

FIGURE 9 Example of the components required for a modern tracking and traceability system 18. Harvest and post-harvest management 559 RFIDs have a number of beneficial uses in addition to traceability; these include inventory management, labour-saving costs, security, and promotion of quality and safety. Barcodes and labels must include all relevant information about the product as required by specific markets. However, as technology develops, it is possible to envisage the inclusion of information (e.g. photographs) about the producer, family and farm as well as attitudes towards sustainability, establishing a closer link between the end consumer and the producer – an invaluable marketing tool. TRANSPORT TO MARKET To maintain product quality through the post-harvest cool chain, palletized loads should be transported from coolstores to markets in refrigerated containers. If optimum temperatures are attained during storage, then short transit journeys from packhouse to market could be undertaken by non-refrigerated “cooltainers” or canvas- sided trucks, but use would be dictated by distance from market, perishability of product and ambient temperatures. For longer journeys to distant markets, it is preferable to use refrigerated containers on planes, trucks or ships, to ensure that storage temperatures are maintained from packhouse to warehouse and beyond. Trucks should preferably have air suspension to reduce vibration damage during transit to the market. Normally products are loaded into precooled 20- or 40-foot reefer containers at the coolstore, preferably from a temperature-controlled plenum between the coolstore and the truck. Pallets are loaded so that maximum airflow can pass uniformly through the pallets to maintain optimum storage temperature during transport to the market. SUPPLY CHAIN The basic considerations and recommendations for maintaining post-harvest quality are similar, regardless of product, location or nature of the distribution system. However, differences in detail will occur in the technologies employed and between products from different production sites depending on the distance from and nature of particular market destinations. Handling, storage and distribution recommendations depend on the time period between the production site and the Plate 12 Examples of miniaturized radio receivers that are used in RFIDs (some specific nanosensors have now been developed especially in relation to monitoring food safety) GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 560 consumers, as well as the ultimate intended use (fresh, processed or fresh-cut). In many countries technologies have been introduced to improve efficiency in the face of rising costs or shortages of labour, materials and energy (not always the case where labour is readily available). Increasingly sophisticated and mandatory quality requirements imposed by international supermarket chains mean that there is a demand for products that are uniform and consistently free from physical, physiological or pathological defects; modern equipment can ensure that only quality products are packed and distributed down the supply chain to consumers. The process of getting products from the farm to the consumer used to be a series of discrete steps organized by independent and unrelated operators; each step had its own cost and the grower received the residue once all costs had been covered. Growers generally received an ever smaller proportion of the final market price as supermarkets increased quality and safety demands. The international horticultural industry is changing: the past decade has seen the development of holistic systems with integration and communication among all firms operating in the supply chain; mutual benefits accrue based on cooperation and sharing of vital information on all aspects of the transactions. The critical steps along the cool chain section of the supply chain (from farm to consumer), are identified on the left.

Harvest and post-harvest management 561 for 365 days of the year. Perishables quality monitoring systems available from several commercial companies provide information in transit. The marketing sector must rapidly provide feedback to suppliers and other supply chain partners, to ensure that quality or market issues can be addressed and sensible decisions made on the basis of supply and demand. This can be done by mobile phone, email or fax, and such information must be accurate, timely and of value to the producer. EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF STAFF Loyal well-trained staff are essential for a successful business. The people who work in post-harvest facilities are more important than the sophistication of the equipment; without well-trained personnel, efficient and sustained operation may be compromised. It is important to ensure that all staff understand the nature of the product being grown, the reasons for the diverse management decisions that have to be made at critical times and the consequences of production and post- harvest mistakes on final profitability of the business. It is strongly suggested that managers establish regular opportunities for staff to update skills and knowledge. Provision of a fair, equitable and friendly working environment is as important as paying good wages if staff are to work in the best interests of the operation. The more they are informed of the enterprise, the more they will consider themselves an integral part of a successful business. GAPs for harvest and post-harvest management Profitability is the key driver for greenhouse production of high quality products to meet market demand when supply is lowest and economic returns are greatest. Consumer needs and requirements must be satisfied: consumers make the final decision about product quality; repeat purchases are the key to ongoing commercial success and sustained profitability. Supply chain perspective must be adopted by growers: all links in the chain are critical to sustained success and profitability. Vertical integration, collaboration, and communication among all firms enhance efficiency and profitability of participants and consumer satisfaction. Supply chain activities must be coordinated from market back to producer so that product movement is smooth, efficient and timely. Technology: new developments must be utilized to optimize handling, storage, transport and quality monitoring and management throughout the supply chain. Pre-harvest factors affect post-harvest quality, including freedom from physiological and pathological disorders; harvesting at the correct maturity is critical for optimal eating quality. Optimal post-harvest handling can maintain but not improve product quality. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 562 BIBLIOGRAPHY Bartz, J.A. & Brecht, J.K.

Storage at optimum temperature, RH and atmosphere helps ensure optimal quality, consumer appeal and economic returns; avoid chilling injury in chill-susceptible products. Cleanliness and sanitation are critical: the packing line should be as simple as possible and clean; water for cleaning should be of potable standard or include approved sanitizers; strict worker hygiene must be maintained. Sorting and grading for uniformity and to prevent damage (e.g. compression, scrapes) that may lead to decay and reduced quality are essential steps. Packaging for maximum product protection, longevity and promotion is important to maximize post-harvest storage potential and provide consumers with quality products in appropriate, convenient and attractive containers; packaging must meet national or international market specifications, generally being recyclable or returnable. Internationally accepted pallets must be used, containers aligned perfectly and pallets strapped. Product knowledge is essential, including market expectations (product specifications, e.g. size, number and maturity) and handling requirements (e.g. temperature, RH and atmosphere, if applicable). Quality assurance systems, traceability protocols and environmental monitoring systems are necessary during storage and transport to markets. Staff education and training is essential so that workers understand what they are doing and why; they must be properly equipped, appropriately compensated and praised for a job well done. 18.

The five main components of cleaner production are related to conserving raw materials, water and energy, eliminating toxic and dangerous raw materials, and reducing the quantity and toxicity of all emissions and wastes at source during the production process. Waste reduction The term “waste” refers to all types, including hazardous and solid waste, liquid and gaseous wastes, waste heat etc. The goal of cleaner production is to eliminate or reduce waste generation. Wastes from a greenhouse vary with different crops, growing technologies and greenhouse structures. Table 1 shows the estimated output of waste from a 1-ha plastic greenhouse with tomatoes grown in non- recirculating perlite as an example. Non-polluting production The concept of cleaner production is a closed loop with zero contaminant release; therefore the ideal production process would be the closed greenhouse tending to GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 566 zero emissions. Energy, fertilizer and pesticide use are the main processes involved in the production of certain emissions. Table 2 shows the main emissions and the corresponding environmental problems arising. Production energy efficiency Energy consumption in Mediterranean countries is very different from in northern countries. In a study comparing tomato production, Williams et al. (2008) found values of 36 MJ kg-1 in the United Kingdom and 8.7 MJ kg-1 in Spain, including transport from the south of Spain to the United Kingdom. Values of 7 MJ kg-1 have also been reported for the Canary Islands, again including transport to the United Kingdom (Torrellas et al., 2008). For tomato production in a Venlo greenhouse, Torrellas et al. (2011) reported a value of 30 MJ kg-1.

Integrated preventive environmental strategy in greenhouse production 567 by Stanhill (1980) gives a value of 7 MJ kg-1 for an unheated glasshouse in Israel with a yield of 20 kg m-2, and 137 Mj kg-1 for a heated glasshouse in the south of England with a yield of 21.3 kg m-2, which would now be considered inefficient energy use. In southern Europe, unheated greenhouse tomato production of 1 and 4 MJ kg-1 has been reported by Muñoz et al. (2008a) and Torrellas et al. (2011), grown in soil and hydroponics, respectively. The differences between the values are quite large, although comparisons were made between the lowest and highest levels of applied technology (Table 3). Although most Mediterranean greenhouses are passive systems with low energy consumption, energy saving could help increase quality and quantity of yields.

In the construction and maintenance of greenhouses, a number of situations present risks to the health and safety of workers (mainly falls and accidents due to the use of construction machinery, tractors, mobile elevating platforms and other machinery.) Extreme climate conditions and pesticide use are other risks that must be considered. Environmentally sound products and packaging The final product and all marketable by-products should be as environmentally sound as possible. Product packaging should be minimized wherever possible, and where used, it should be as environmentally friendly as possible. Health and environmental factors must be addressed at the earliest point of product and process design and must be considered throughout the product life cycle, from production through use and disposal. QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS The ISO 9000 family of standards represents an international consensus on good quality management practices. It consists of standards and guidelines relating to quality management systems and related supporting standards. ISO 9001 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization wishes to demonstrate its ability to provide products that consistently meet customer needs and the necessary regulatory requirements. It attempts to promote customer satisfaction by applying the system effectively. Certain processes are included to continuously improve the system, assuring conformity to the customer as well as to the appropriate regulatory needs. It is a certification of internationally accepted standards (ISO-9001, 2008). In protected horticulture, the adoption of continuous improvement must also be considered. In order to optimize greenhouse production, it is necessary to adopt the Deming Cycle: Plan-Do- Check-Act (PDCA), also known as Plan-Do-Study- Act (PDSA). Suitable indicators to evaluate the installations and record their values over time must be identified, using devices such as water counters, energy controllers and climatic sensors. Principles of cleaner production • Waste reduction • Non-polluting production • Production energy efficiency • Safe and healthy work environment • Environmentally sound products and packaging Continuous improvement • Planning • Doing • Checking: use of indicators and devices to register • Acting or implementing 19. Integrated preventive environmental strategy in greenhouse production 569 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT – LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool for assessing the potential environmental impact of a product or system, considering the product’s life cycle from resource extraction to waste disposal. ISO standardization provides guidelines to follow in an LCA study to guarantee objectivity. According to the ISO-14040 (2006) guidelines, an LCA study can be divided into four phases: • definition of goals and scope • analysis of inventory analysis • impact assessment • interpretation Goal and scope definition This is the phase in which the initial choices that determine the working plan for the whole LCA are made. The scope of the study is defined in terms of temporal, geographical and technological coverage.

It is during this phase that each functional unit (FU) is also defined. The FU describes the primary function of a product system; for example, if product supply is the function under consideration, the FU may be yield per square metre. The FU provides a reference to which input and output data can be normalized mathematically. Comparability of LCA is particularly critical when different systems are being assessed. To ensure that comparisons are made on a common basis, the same relevant service must be considered – not always obvious in agricultural products (provision of food or nutrients, production of yield, earning money etc.). Inventory analysis The life cycle inventory (LCI) phase is the second phase of an LCA. The inventory analysis lists all extractions of resources and emissions of substances attributable to the FU under consideration. This involves the collection of the data required to meet the goals of the defined study. To be precise, an allocation of the input and output flows has to be performed in processes in which two or more products are produced or sub-produced. Allocation is a complex issue and is particularly relevant in agricultural production because agricultural systems are characterized by closely interlinking subsystems of activities (Audsley, 1997). Impact assessment The impact assessment phase of an LCA aims to evaluate the significance of potential environmental impacts using the LCI results. The final goal is to have information about how an activity, process or product can affect different areas of protection (AoP): human, health, ecosystem quality and resource use. A series of different environmental categories are assessed: midpoint when closer to an impact pathway; endpoint when closer to an AoP. • Midpoint categories comprise classical impact assessment methods – CML (Guinée et al., 2002) or EDIP (Hauschild and Wenzel, 1998) – restricting quantitative modelling to relatively early stages in the cause-effect chain. • Endpoint categories comprise damage-oriented methods – Eco-indicator 99 (Goedkoop and Spriensma, 2000) or EPS (Steen, 1999) – which try to model the cause-effect chain up to the endpoint or where damage occurs (directly correlated to AoP). The main contributions to impact in Mediterranean greenhouses are structure and fertilizer use. Interpretation Interpretation is the final phase of an LCA; conclusions are drawn, recommendations made. The results of the analysis and all the choices and assumptions made are discussed, and opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts of the FU, such as changes in product, process and activity design, raw material use, industrial processing and waste management, are identified and evaluated. From studies in 19. Integrated preventive environmental strategy in greenhouse production 571 Mediterranean greenhouses (Antón et al., 2004), the following conclusions can be made: • The greenhouse structure has the greatest impact in most environmental categories except the toxicity indicators. This is due to the relatively short life span of plastic-covered greenhouse structures with minimal inputs of external energy in the production process. • Further research must look to reducing the environmental impact of the materials used in the structures for passive greenhouse crops. Substitution with recycled materials with a longer life span is a possible solution. • The types of cladding compared in this study (PC sheet and LDPE film) are not particularly important in environmental analysis. • Improving fertilizer use and looking for alternative local substrates, preferably derived from reused materials, are other important factors to take into account.

This section provides a brief description of the risks associated with greenhouse production and of the preventive measures to adopt. Any protocol to prevent health and safety risks in the greenhouse should comply with the law of the country and be accompanied by the company’s commitment to maintain a policy of prevention and continuous improvement. Risk prevention in greenhouses should focus on the greenhouse construction, maintenance and work culture. Greenhouse construction and maintenance Various situations arising in the construction and maintenance of greenhouses may constitute a health and safety risk for workers. As most risks are not specific to greenhouses but are derived from construction activities (laying foundations, building the structure, installing vent openings etc.) or maintenance (changing plastics, liming etc.), the preventive measures taken in a greenhouse should be the same as those taken in any construction activity or maintenance work. However, Environmental bottlenecks • Use of fertilizers • Use of substrates • Water use • Waste management • Infrastructure and equipment • Logistics • Energy use GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 572 certain risk-associated tasks typical of greenhouse building and maintenance should be highlighted: • installation of plastic, glass and ventilation structures • renovation, bleaching or cleaning of plastic These tasks require work at the height of the infrastructure and pose a major risk of falls and accidents; they should therefore be viewed as for working on a high building. As a general rule, workers should use scaffolding, lifting platforms and safety harnesses. Greenhouse management Tasks inside the greenhouse involve a number of potential risks in addition to the usual risks of working in agriculture. Safety risks • Fall from heights during harvest. • Entrapment by overturning or collapsing mobile elevating platforms. • Tractors overturning. • Falling objects, such as shading nets and strengthening arches. • Use of construction machinery adapted for use in a greenhouse without the necessary safeguards. • Electrical contacts with power lines during cleaning or replacement of plastics. Hygiene risks • Heat stroke due to unfavourable hygrometric thermal exposure conditions – evaluation using standardized methodologies (WBCT Index) required, as well as rehydration areas, breaks etc. • Application and use of plant protection product – risks as for outside, but aggravated by high temperature, humidity and use in enclosed area. Legal measures should be established in each country; “No trespassing” signs need to be installed during treatment. • Exposure to pesticide residues for workers entering treated fields or greenhouse facilities. The worker exposure scenario and individual work practices determine worker risk exposure (e.g. during tomato reach-and-pick work, dermal exposure is estimated at 0.10 mg of pesticide per kg of body weight per day; exposure risk for an applicator is 0.0012 mg active ingredient per kg of body weight per day – Whitford et al., 1999). Ergonomic risks • Back injury as a result of awkward posture and manual handling of loads. 19. Integrated preventive environmental strategy in greenhouse production 573 POLLUTION PREVENTION Air emissions: CO2 equivalents, N emissions, pesticides CO2 release is mainly related to energy use. While most Mediterranean greenhouses in the horticultural sector are passive (i.e. without heating or lighting), alternative energy sources (not fossil fuels) must still be sought since, for example, large quantities of fossil fuels are used to manufacture nitrogen fertilizers. Many energy companies offer “green power”, produced from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro and solar. It costs a little more than conventional power, but the extra cost can be covered by improving energy-use efficiency. Nitrous oxide from agriculture is released from nitrogen compounds present in manure, fertilizers, crops, soils and watercourses. It tends to be produced in oxygen-free conditions. The most effective way to reduce the release of this gas is to use nitrogen fertilizers and manures efficiently so that the crop requirement is met while losses of nitrogen are minimized.

Water pollution: NO3, P and pesticides Groundwater can become contaminated by greenhouse fertilizers, pesticides, washdown waters, and roof shading and cleaning; if a substrate is used, this too has potential environmental consequences. Figure 3 compares closed systems with free drainage and soil cultivation. While eutrophication clearly improved in closed systems, other factors (e.g. the depletion of non-renewable resources and the formation of photochemical oxidants) increased due to the greater quantity of materials used in these systems. Once collected, the solution is immediately recirculated or held for later recirculation. In both cases, the solution may have to be reconditioned for reuse. Collecting, treating and recycling greenhouse effluent is one of the best solutions to this environmental problem. Occupational health and safety – Summary Greenhouse construction and maintenance: • Risk of falling during installation of plastic, glass and ventilation structures • Risks associated with the renovation, bleaching or cleaning of plastic Greenhouse management: • Safety risks: falls, use of platforms, tractors, construction machinery and electric contacts • Hygiene risks: hygrometric thermal exposure and pesticide exposition (during application and other works) • Ergonomic risks: awkward postures and handling loads GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 574 At some time, in particular in Mediterranean conditions, some or all of the nutrient solution must be disposed of, owing to salt imbalance, disease or contamination, or because the end of a crop cycle has been reached. Disposal is potentially polluting, therefore the method of release must be chosen with care. The preferred methods are: release to sewage systems or holding/settling ponds; or as irrigation water to adjacent field crops. The least preferred is discharge into tile drains or surface water. For most crops there is potential for fertilizer reduction. For example, with tomato, Muñoz et al. (2008b) showed that fertilizers can be decreased from 11 to 7 mmol/litre of N without affecting yields and reducing the environmental impact by nearly 50 percent. Recycling of materials Greenhouses produce large amounts of waste; in particular, greenhouse production systems create large quantities of solid waste (steel, plastics and non-yield biomass). There is increasing use of recirculated or closed systems in order to reduce pollution associated with the use of fertilizers and to save water. These are cultivation systems in which the water drained from the root zone is collected and reused to irrigate the same crop. However, soilless closed systems require additional material (benches, collection pipes, bags of substrate, soil covering film etc.), generating a large quantity of waste. At the end of their “life”, these materials are traditionally incinerated or disposed of in a landfill. Some companies recycle plastics, but recycling costs vary: they depend not only on the material, but also on market-determined factors, FIGURE 3 Comparison of environmental impacts for closed systems, with free drainage and soil cultivation: a) eutrophication, kg P2O5 per kg tomato and b) depletion of non-renewable resources, per year per kg tomato Higher values are worse Anton, 2004 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 closed system open system soil a 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 year - 1 b 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 closed system open system soil a 19.

For areas of high production or for more developed productions, the organic fraction can be treated in plants based on more technological complex processes (composting in-vessel or anaerobic digestion plus composting). Plastics Plastics – plastic film from greenhouses, ground covers and substrate bags – are major sources of waste. The technology exists to recycle plastic film, but recycling companies want the plastic to be dry and clean, and this can be difficult. If plastic items such as plant trays are reused, choosing more durable products can increase their life. The manufacturer should be contacted to see if a recycling system is in place. Finally, a promising option for the future is the use of biodegradables materials, especially when they are in contact with the plant, such as trellising clips or soil mulching. Steel Although most of the frame of commercial greenhouses is made of recycled steel, the alternative use of local materials should still be considered. Simple structures (wood and plastic), with their low-level technology and associated low energy consumption, have a lower environmental impact than medium level (steel and plastic) and more complex (alluminium and glass) structures (Russo and Scarascia-Mugnozza, 2004). Medina et al. (2006), using LCA methodology, provide an overall picture of energy costs and environmental burdens associated with greenhouse tomato production in the Bogota Plateau (Colombia), showing the very low energy use associated with the low level of technology used there. Substrate Peat from peat bag culture (tomatoes, cucumbers) can be recycled and used by landscape firms. Peat is organic, environmentally friendly and people are eager to use it for landscaping and gardening. However it is a natural resource and its use has an environmental impact associated with the depletion of renewable resources. Wherever possible: • reduce • reuse • recycle GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 576 Inorganic substrates (e.g. rockwool) do not decompose and must be dumped in landfill sites. Recycling of rockwool must be offered by suppliers, who should in turn have recycling procedures. Inorganic expanded clay (e.g. perlite) does not break down and, with sterilization, could be reused; it is still undergoing development. Other substrates include coconut fibre and stonewool. Composting of green biomass Studies show that source segregation followed by the composting of biodegradable matter is the best way of managing waste and reducing the impact in most of the categories considered. The maximum reduction in the environmental impact by segregation of non-yield biomass and its subsequent composting is that relating to climate change. The impact in this category could be reduced by 40–70 percent, depending on whether landfill or incineration is considered (Antón et al., 2005). Disposal: landfill, incineration, others Historically, collected waste went to the local dump where open burning was used to reduce its volume. More recently, waste management technologies have become increasingly sophisticated, but the success rate depends also on the retailers (not all are involved) and on existing government regulations, which are not the same throughout the Mediterranean. CONCLUSIONS Sustainable management in greenhouse production means production of high quality food with guaranteed use of environmentally friendly renewable energy and raw materials. In rural areas, it also entails positive economic development by generating jobs and income. Greenhouse production in the future must be sustainable and productive, while conserving natural resources for coming generations. In summary, for an integrated preventive environmental strategy in greenhouse production, the following recommendations are made: • Be aware of the life cycle approach to avoid externalizing impacts. • Optimize doses of fertilizers and pesticides. • Implement an efficient system of waste management: reduction, recycling, treatment and disposal. • Develop occupational health and safety policies. Priorities in pollution prevention • Reduce: energy saving, fertilizer dosification, pesticide use • Recirculate: closed systems • Reuse: materials, lixiviates in adjacent field crops etc. • Compost: green biomass • Recycle: plastic materials, substrates, composting • Other disposal methods or treatments 19.

Product safety Manuela Allara,a Marjon Fredrix,a Catherine Bessy a and Frederike Praasterink b 1 a Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy b Agricultural University for Applied Science, Hogeschool HAS Den Bosch, the Netherlands INTRODUCTION In fruit and vegetable supply chains, food safety is an increasingly important factor. This chapter provides a reference guide for the inclusion of food safety in training programmes for farmers and workers in greenhouse vegetable production in the Mediterranean region. Greenhouse cultivation has extended significantly in the Mediterranean region during the last 30 years, and there is still wide scope for improvement. With greenhouse cultivation systems (glass or plastic film cover, low or walking tunnels etc.), it is possible to regulate the environmental conditions, extend the crop growing and harvesting period, safeguard product quality and improve market access. Food safety issues are relevant to all these areas. Health (consumer protection) is the main entry point for food safety herein. However, under certain conditions, marketing benefits may also result from improved food safety and quality. Food safety of fresh produce is all the more important in view of the dramatic increase in human health problems related to unhealthy dietary patterns (e.g. diabetes type 2, coronary heart diseases, some cancers). Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables is high on policy agendas, and food safety, therefore, plays a major role in consumer acceptance and thus marketing opportunities. This chapter has been adapted from the Food Safety Manual for farmer field schools (FFS), developed in 2010 for the FAO Plant Production and Protection 1 The authors worked on a previous document, Food safety manual for farmer field schools, by Frederike Praasterink, Harry Van der Wulp, Anne Sophie Poisot, Marjon Fredrix, Catherine Bessy, Alfredo Impiglia, Alma Linda Morales Abubakar, Areepan Upanisakorn and Jan Ketelaar.

WHAT IS FOOD SAFETY? Food is considered safe when there are no negative effects on consumer health due to contamination: food safety is the absence of adverse health effects resulting from food contamination. It is a scientific discipline that identifies the production, handling, preparation and storage procedures of food so as to prevent food-borne illness. Food safety is very important for: • consumer health protection – people should not get sick from eating contaminated food. • market access – some national governments or retailers require food safety certificates; if farmers do not produce according to specific criteria (e.g. maximum residue levels for pesticides), they cannot sell produce through those markets and when there is significant occurrence of food-borne illness in a region, international markets can be stricter about acceptance of food products from that region. Food safety hazards are any chemical, biological or physical substance or property that can cause fruits and vegetables to become an unacceptable health risk to consumers. Chemical hazards may include heavy metals, or pesticide residues exceeding maximum authorized levels; biological hazards include pathogenic bacteria (e.g. E. coli or Salmonella), parasites and viruses associated with the crop; physical hazards can be pieces of glass or stones in the product. Attention to food safety is increasing for a variety of reasons: • Increase in global trade • Production in new areas with less developed food safety programmes • New (convenience) products, such as fresh-cut fruit and vegetables and salads 20. Product safety 583 • New production, processing and storage methods • Scaled-up production to meet increasing demand without adequate risk analysis • Emerging micro-organisms with different levels of virulence and persistence • Introduction of new organisms into regions • Changes in people’s susceptibility and awareness Eating contaminated food can have acute or long-term effects. An acute (immediate) effect is people getting sick (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea) shortly after eating contaminated food. Long-term (chronic) effects are related to long-term consequences of acute infections (e.g. Shiga toxin producing E. coli), or may result from a gradual buildup of unhealthy substances (chemicals or toxins) in the body – at very high levels, people get sick and may even die (e.g. toxic levels of cadmium in human kidneys). WHAT IS FOOD QUALITY? Food quality is the combination of a product’s characteristics valued by the consumer. Food quality is subjective: it means different things to different people and may take into account any of the following: • nutritional factors (e.g. vitamin content) • sensorial properties (e.g. taste, smell) • appearance (e.g. colour, size, firmness, absence of bruises and damage) • social considerations (e.g. traditions, food culture) • convenience (e.g. preparation, shelf-life, easy peeling) • food safety There is a growing demand for improved quality of food due to globalization of trade and markets (creating a need for standardization of production and quality of food), changing lifestyles (more convenience food, and increased consumption of meat and dairy) and a growing number of food safety outbreaks. Most consumers buy food based on appearance, price and convenience. Food safety is often not specifically considered, because it is assumed by consumers that fruit and vegetables are healthy and safe to eat. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Many farmer interventions to improve the safety of fruits and vegetables also help improve the quality.

The food chain is the process from farming to consumer: along this chain food is produced, manipulated, transformed, packaged, stored, transported and consumed by a range of stakeholders, each of which influences product safety. The efforts of some stakeholders to produce and maintain a safe product can easily be ruined by others not paying attention to hygienic prescriptions related to the activities under their responsibility. All players in the food chain are responsible and must share a common goal: ensure safe food at all steps in the chain. Among these stakeholders, farmers have responsibility for food safety before and during production, harvest, post-harvest and on-farm storage.

All players in the food chain are responsible and must share a common goal: ensure safe food at all steps in the chain. Among these stakeholders, farmers have responsibility for food safety before and during production, harvest, post-harvest and on-farm storage. Food contamination can also occur further down the food chain and that is – in most cases – beyond the responsibility and control of the farmer. However, the level of pre-harvest contamination determines the effectiveness of control measures through the rest of the food chain. Once a product becomes contaminated it is very difficult to remove the contamination. Governments have overall responsibility for national food safety policies and their enforcement. Factors affecting both food safety and quality • Seeds. Good quality and from a safe source, affect performance, provide variety demanded by the market. • Soils (or substrate, such as hydroponics). Location chosen in consideration of safety and quality of soils, soil preparation method. • Plant management. Spacing, weeding, minimizing mechanical injury pre- and post-harvest. • Water. Quantity, quality, irrigation techniques. • Fertilizers and soil amendments. Major influence on shape, shelf-life, taste (e.g. sugar content of fruit) and contamination; organic fertilizers do not imply exclusive rights to good taste or increased safety. • Diseases and pests. IPM, timing and quality of pesticide used (consumer choice of good- looking versus chemical-free produce), general greenhouse hygiene and maintenance influencing pest population levels. • Post-harvest handling. Maturity stage, harvesting techniques, equipment and hygiene, time of harvest, sorting and grading practices and hygiene, washing prior to sale in clean water and appropriate use of sanitizers, hygiene and maintenance of equipment and facility, human contact etc. • Storage. Conditions, length, use of preservation chemicals, storage containers and storage atmospheres. • Transport. Packaging quality, storage time and temperature, means of transport etc. 20. Product safety 585 This manual focuses on agricultural production, and it is therefore important to carry out a detailed analysis of what farmers can do to prevent food safety hazards. It is necessary to be critical but also realistic with regard to potential improvements using appropriate farming practices. When more prominent risks arise later in the food chain, partnerships could have a role in guaranteeing food safety, for example, with farmers working together in associations or making longer-term marketing arrangements with middlemen or with contract growers for a processing factory. BETTER OPPORTUNITIES WITH IMPROVED FOOD SAFETY Safe food is expected by consumers and the food chain has a responsibility to produce it. Market access is an important driver within the food chain and can be central in specific areas, but it should not be the only driver or the sole reason for attention to and development of a strategy for food safety. Implementing activities at farmer level to improve food safety and quality may be cumbersome, in terms of both money and time (e.g. record-keeping). Farmers may be motivated by good product prices (cost-benefit) or by the potential to maintain market access. Training is often necessary to understand the importance and benefits of food safety and product quality. For example, farmers using integrated pest management (IPM) often use fewer pesticides than conventional farmers, benefiting both the environment and workers (Sette and Garba, 2009; Near East IPM programme). Some farmers try to market their IPM produce as “safe” or “clean”. However, in many countries safer food products cannot be recognized by consumers or buyers since there is no official certificate or logo. In addition, most consumers buy products on the basis of quality attributes (e.g. appearance, taste and shelf-life), simply assuming the food is safe. If safe produce is to reach better markets, it Plate 2 Farmers marketing IPM vegetables HTTP://WWW.IPM-NEAREAST.COM/ Safer produce profitable for farmers: the Palestinian case Impact studies by An Najah National University (2006–09) revealed the following results on the impact of the IPM/FFS approach: • Greenhouse cucumber: reduction in use of insecticides (40%), less in fungicides (35%), no significant change in herbicides. • Greenhouse tomato: reduction in use of insecticides (55%), fungicides (40%), no significant change in herbicides. • Reduction in total input costs of about 20%, while yields increased on average by 15% providing a notable improvement to the farmers", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 586 should also display other quality attributes; it would therefore be useful if training programmes for IPM farmers also integrated quality aspects. Some countries have come up with activities to promote IPM produce, creating logos or labels (e.g. in Jordan) or establishing direct sales to supermarkets or hotels. There is no single answer to whether better food safety at production level leads to improved marketing opportunities and higher prices. It depends on the local conditions and market requirements – both local and for export. Trainers must help farmers understand requirements for specific market opportunities; within FFS training in West Africa, for example, food safety aspects are taken into account in market research. Examples of linking farmers to markets can be found on the FAO internet site (e.g. the one-page case study found at www.fao.org/ag/ ags/subjects/en/agmarket/linkages/index.html). IS FOOD SAFETY NECESSARY FOR ALL FARMERS? From a public health perspective, food safety is necessary. It is also important from an economic and market access point of view. Safe food is also essential for the domestic market, as importers look at local food safety aspects when selecting trading partners. All farmers must apply good farming practices to produce safe food. However, not all countries have appropriate guidelines, certification and training programmes and controls on food safety issues. Often, it is more difficult for small farmholders to comply with good agricultural practices than it is for large farmholders. Trainers should raise awareness of basic food safety principles and concepts; they need to understand the main food safety risks in a community and then work with farmers to identify them and introduce feasible practices to improve food safety. It is important that food safety is integrated into training programmes.

Product safety 587 TYPES OF FOOD SAFETY HAZARDS There are various types of food safety hazards, including chemical, biological and physical; examples are described below. Chemical hazards Harmful chemicals at high levels have been associated with chronic illness and death, for example, after eating food with high pesticide residues. In many developing countries, pesticides from vegetables are a major food safety risk, especially if long-term exposure – leading to chronic conditions and consequent pathologies – is taken into account. Biological hazards Micro-organisms or microbes are small organisms visible only through a microscope. They are found everywhere in the environment: fruit and vegetables contain a dynamic and diverse mixture of micro-organisms, and products handled daily may contain as many as 100 million organisms per gram – normal inhabitants that do not affect the health of consumers. There are three types of interaction with food: • Beneficial – acts on food to produce desirable quality characteristics, such as aroma, texture, microbiological stability (e.g. yeast and fungi for making cheese such as Danish Blue). TABLE 2 Chemical hazards Hazards Causes of contamination (examples) Pesticide residues in produce exceeding maximum residue limits (MRLs)a Pesticide not approved for target crop Incorrect mixing and higher than recommended dosages Withholding period (harvest interval) not observed Equipment faulty or not calibrated Pesticide residues in soil from previous use Dumping or accidental spillage of pesticide into soil or water source Non-pesticide contamination such as lubricants, cleaners and sanitizers, paint, refrigerants, vermin", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The generic trend is that national MRLs are aligned with the Codex MRLs, although discrepancies exist. However, specific markets may have their own requirements that complement Codex and they must be checked for a specific location or conditions. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 588 • Spoilage – produces undesirable quality characteristics such as softening, bad odour and flavour (e.g. fruit rots). • Pathogenic – affects consumer health, with illness caused either by the micro- organism itself growing inside the human after eating (infection) or by toxins produced by the micro-organism (intoxication). In the case of pathogenic interaction, the most common types of micro- organism are bacteria, parasites and viruses. Bacteria The most common cause of food-borne illness, bacteria require nutrients and appropriate environmental conditions to grow. They can grow rapidly under appropriate conditions in a very short time – in 7 hours, one bacterial cell can generate over a million cells. Common pathogenic bacteria linked to contamination of fresh fruit and vegetables are: • Salmonella species • Escherichia coli (E. coli) pathogenic strains • Campylobacter species • Listeria monocytogenes • Bacillus cereus Some bacteria can be found in the soil (Listeria sp., Bacillus cereus) and contamination may occur directly via contact with the soil or with dirty containers and equipment. Other bacteria pass through the intestinal tract of animals and humans, and fruits and vegetables become contaminated either through manure or contaminated soil and water, or when humans handle produce. Parasites Parasites inhabit another living organism – the host. While unable to multiply outside an animal or human host, they can cause illness with only a low number of organisms. Fruit and vegetables are potential vehicles for passing parasites from one host to another: animal to human or human to human. Cysts, the dormant phase of parasites, that aid survival in unfavourable environmental conditions, remain infectious for many years in the soil (e.g. Giardia). Water contaminated with faecal material, infected food handlers and animals in the field or packing shed are all potential vehicles for contamination of produce with parasites. Parasites commonly associated with contaminated fruit and vegetables are: • Cryptosporidium • Cyclospora • Giardia • Helminths 20. Product safety 589 Viruses Viruses are very small and unable to reproduce outside of a living cell. Human enteric viruses do not grow in or on fruit and vegetables; however, produce can act as a vehicle to pass viruses from animals to humans or from humans to humans. Low numbers of surviving viruses on produce can cause illness. Viruses passed to humans through contaminated produce are: • Hepatitis A • Norovirus Physical hazards Physical hazards are foreign objects that can cause illness or injury to consumers. Contamination can occur during production and post-harvest handling. Physical hazards include glass, wood, metal, plastic, soil and stones, personal items (e.g. jewellery, hair", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Contamination can occur during production and post-harvest handling. Physical hazards include glass, wood, metal, plastic, soil and stones, personal items (e.g. jewellery, hair clips), paint flakes, insulation, sticks, weed seeds, toxic weeds. Other hazards Food safety hazards may also occur through genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which may cause allergic reactions. Nano-technology (e.g. nano-pesticides) can also cause food safety hazards (Nanoall, 2010). Further research is required in order to better understand the associated hazards. Factors affecting risk of biological contamination How the produce is grown: • Products grown in the ground (carrots) or close to the ground (lettuce or melons) are at higher risk than those grown well above the ground (tomato and pepper). • Products in frequent contact with water are more exposed, and risk therefore increases (e.g. hydroponic production). Product surface: • Products with a large uneven surface (melon with netted rinds, lettuce and strawberries) are at greater risk than those with a smooth surface (eggplant). How the produce is consumed: • Products eaten raw (leafy vegetables) are at higher risk than cooked produce (potato). • Products with edible skin (strawberry) carry a greater risk than products with inedible skin. TABLE 3 Physical hazards Hazards Causes of contamination (examples) Foreign objects from the environment – soil, stones, sticks, weed seeds Harvesting of ground crops during wet weather Dirty harvesting and packing equipment, picking containers, packaging materials Stacking of dirty containers on top of produce Foreign objects from equipment, containers, buildings and structures – glass, wood, metal, plastic, paint flakes Broken lights above packing equipment and areas where produce is exposed Damaged picking containers, harvesting and packing equipment, pallets Inadequate cleaning after repairs and maintenance Foreign objects from human handling of produce – jewelry, hair clips, personal items Careless or untrained staff Inappropriate clothing GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 590 Food safety hazard analysis Obviously, not all sources of contamination are applicable to all farms; it is important to carry out a detailed hazard analysis to identify the main sources of food safety problems. It is then easier to define the steps to avoid contamination. Facilitators, trainers or national extension programme coordinators may need the assistance of a local food safety expert for a comprehensive hazard analysis of the crops and locations selected under the programme. When possible, facilitators and trainers should be involved in the analysis in order to improve their skills. A participatory hazard analysis is a good exercise for the farmers’ group: it can be a basis for identifying good practices to minimize risk, which can then be addressed during training and tested on the farms. FIGURE 2 Sources of contamination of food Since not all sources are equally important in all situations, it is important to do a food safety hazard analysis (see below). http://www.dise asencure.com/s.jpg Chemical, biological, physical hazards Pesticides Water Fertilizers (incl. manure, compost) Other chemicals Soil Farm workers Planting materials Animals, pests Equipment, containers, tools, materials, waste Facilities, vehicles 20. Product safety 591 GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES TO MANAGE FOOD SAFETY Activities conducted to produce safe food are called good farming practices or good agricultural practices (GAP). Good farming practices reduce or prevent food safety hazards. GAPs for vegetables grown in greenhouses to avoid food safety hazards linked to different sources of contamination (Figure 2) are detailed below. They must be applied at all stages of crop production: from planning and preparation of the soil and growing area, to planting, crop and greenhouse management, harvesting and post-harvest handling. All people working on or entering the farm are involved and should be aware of their responsibilities in the production of safe food. Training of farmers, farm workers and associated groups, such as packers and transporters, may be necessary. An example of hazards and good farming practices for various cropping stages or greenhouse and farm operations is given in the Food Safety Manual for FFS (farmer field schools). Since most training programmes follow the cropping cycle, it makes sense to add food safety elements according to cropping stages.

An example of hazards and good farming practices for various cropping stages or greenhouse and farm operations is given in the Food Safety Manual for FFS (farmer field schools). Since most training programmes follow the cropping cycle, it makes sense to add food safety elements according to cropping stages. A number of structured learning exercises can be done with greenhouse farmers and workers to list and practise good farming practices applicable to a specific crop and location. It is important to be very practical and work with those practices that are relevant to the greenhouses. Facilitators can help the FFS group identify and prioritize food safety hazards and select good farming practices that are appropriate and locally feasible for their control. CONCLUSION This chapter provides a context for food safety, indicates potential sources of hazards and specifies measures to address concerns related to food safety issues. These measures should be adapted to local conditions and considered alongside the GAPs provided in other chapters of this book. Addressing food safety issues in vegetable production can provide improved nutrition at local level, as well as increased access to market opportunities. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 592 Planting materials: seeds, varieties or rootstocks Food safety hazard: Chemical and biological contamination of produce from pesticides used during production of planting material. GAP recommendations: • Use certified and good quality seeds or planting material if possible (special consideration should be given to the advantages and disadvantages of using GMO seeds, when applicable). • Keep a record of the name of the supplier of planting material and the date of purchase. • If planting material is produced on the farm, keep a record of any chemical treatments used. Site history and management Food safety hazard: Chemical and biological contamination of produce from prior use of the site or from sources of contamination external to the site. GAP recommendations: • Assess the risk of contaminating produce from chemical and biological hazards present in or near the site for each horticultural activity; keep a record of any significant hazards identified. • Where a significant risk of chemical or biological contamination has been identified, do not use the site for horticultural production or take remedial action to manage the risk. Soil remediation is possible, but it is expensive and laborious, and requires proper assessment of the type of contaminant to ensure its effectiveness. • If remedial action is required to manage the risk, monitor actions to check that contamination of produce does not occur. • Report the location of any sites identified as unsuitable for horticultural production, and refer to local authorities for appropriate action. • Exclude entry of farm animals in the site for 3 months before planting and during crop production, particularly for crops grown in or close to the ground. • Position the greenhouse in consideration of prevailing winds and solar radiation, to ensure optimal environmental conditions inside the structure, where possible avoiding flood sites or sites that may be exposed to water runoff.

GAP recommendations: • Assess the origin of water used for irrigation and the potential for contamination. • Prefer water of safe quality, e.g. from protected deep wells. • Use safe quality water during growth stages and potable water near to harvest and consumption. • Use irrigation drip in preference to spray to reduce exposure. • Assess the risk of chemical and biological contamination of produce from water used for irrigation for each horticultural activity, and keep a record of any significant hazards identified. • Where water testing is required to assess the risk of produce contamination, conduct tests at a frequency appropriate to the conditions impacting on the water supply and the horticultural activity, and keep a record of test results. • Where there is high risk of chemical and biological contamination, either use a safe alternative water source or treat and monitor the water and keep a record of the monitoring results. • Maintain wells, tanks and irrigation ditches and pipes in good working condition to avoid water stagnation. • Review existing practices and crop growing conditions to identify potential sources of contamination. • If feedlots, animal pastures and dairy operations are in the region, use and maintain fences or other barriers to minimize animal access to shared water sources. • Find out if manure is applied by many farms in the region. • Find out how local rainfall patterns and topography affect the likelihood that contaminated runoff from these operations will reach surface waters available for irrigation. Pesticides (agrochemicals) Biological food safety hazard: Biological contamination of produce from contaminated water used to apply pesticides. GAP recommendations: • Where pesticides are applied to the edible part of a product within 2 days of harvest, assess the risk of biological contamination and keep a record of any significant hazards identified. • Where the risk of biological contamination is significant, either use a safe alternative water source or treat and monitor the water, keeping a record of the results. 20. Product safety 595 Pesticides (agrochemicals) (cont’d) Chemical food safety hazard: Chemical contamination of produce above maximum residue levels (MRLs) during storage, application and disposal of pesticides used for crop protection. GAP recommendations: • Train farm managers and workers to a level appropriate to their area of responsibility for pesticide application. • Where possible use integrated pest management systems and non-chemical products to minimize the use of chemicals (Table 1, Plate 5). • Use pesticides approved for the targeted crop; apply according to label directions or in line with a permit issued by a government authority, and at intervals so as to prevent residue levels in excess of the MRL. • For produce exported to another country, verify approval of chemicals and MRL in the destination country prior to use. • Use pesticide mixtures only with compatible chemicals and low risk of excessive residues. • Observe withholding periods between pesticide application and harvest. • Calibrate equipment used to apply pesticides at least annually and carry out regular maintenance. • Wash equipment after each use and dispose of washing waste so as to present no risk of contaminating produce. • Dispose of surplus application mixes so as", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Labelling and certification: integrated farm assurance with fruit and vegetable production Kyriacos Patsalos Managing Director, Qualitycert Ltd Agricultural Consultants, Cyprus INTRODUCTION The challenge of globalizing markets is nowhere greater than in the primary food sector. GLOBALG.A.P. is an equal partnership of agricultural producers and retailers and has established itself as a key reference for good agricultural practice (GAP) in the global marketplace, becoming a widely used and acceptable GAP standard. GLOBALG.A.P. is a private sector body that sets voluntary standards for the certification of agricultural products around the globe. The aim is to establish one standard for GAP with different product applications capable of fitting the whole of global agriculture. GLOBALG.A.P. is a global scheme and a reference for good agricultural practices managed by the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat. It includes topics such as integrated crop management (ICM), integrated pest control (IPC), quality management system (QMS), hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP), workers’ health, safety and welfare, environmental pollution and conservation management. Several on-farm assurance systems were in place in many countries prior to the existence of GLOBALG.A.P. (formerly known as EUREPGAP). Due to consumer demands, it was necessary to find a way to encourage the development of regionally adjusted management systems in order to prevent farmers from having to undergo multiple audits. Existing national or regional farm assurance schemes that have successfully completed their benchmarking process are recognized as equivalent to GLOBALG.A.P. More specifically, the GLOBALG.A.P. Integrated Farm Assurance (IFA) standard (version 4) is a pre-farmgate standard or on-farm standard that covers the certification of the whole agricultural production process of the product: from farm inputs (e.g. feed or seedlings) and all farming activities until the product leaves GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 604 the farm. The information in this report is derived from the GLOBALG.A.P. IFA standard (version 4). A business-to-business label, the standard is not directly visible to consumers; it provides the standard and framework for independent, recognized third party certification of farm production processes based on the ISO/ IEC Guide 65 (management system standard issued by the International Standards Organization through which independent certification bodies are accredited). The standard comprises a set of normative documents: GLOBALG.A.P. General Regulations, GLOBALG.A.P. Control Points and Compliance Criteria, and GLOBALG.A.P. Checklist (Web site: www.globalgap.org). The IFA Control Points and Compliance Criteria (CPCC) document is organized in modules to cover various areas or levels of activity on a production site: • “Scopes” – covering more generic production issues, classified more broadly as: All Farm Base (AF) Crops Base (CB)", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Specifically, AF and CB are classified as follows: Fruit and Vegetables (FV) Combinable Crops (CC) Coffee (green) (CO) Tea (TE) Flowers and Ornamental (FO) Only products included in the GLOBALG.A.P. product list may be certified. Fruits and vegetables cultivated outdoors or in greenhouses are included in the list and are eligible for certification. CERTIFICATION OPTIONS The options available for certification depend on the constitution of the legal entity applying for certification. Individual certification (Option 1) • Individual producer applies for certification (GLOBALG.A.P. or a benchmarked scheme). • Individual producer is the certificate holder once certified. - Multisite without implementation of a quality management system (QMS): individual producer or one organization owns several production 21. Labelling and certification: integrated farm assurance 605 locations or management units which do not function as separate legal entities. - Multisite with implementation of a QMS: individual producer or one organization owns several production locations or management units which do not function as separate legal entities, but where a QMS has been implemented; in this case, General Regulations Part II – QMS Rules apply. Multisites with QMS and producer groups (Option 2) • Producer group applies for group certification (GLOBALG.A.P. or benchmarked scheme). • The group, as a legal entity, is the certificate holder once certified. • A group must have a QMS implemented and comply with General Regulations Part II – QMS Rules. Benchmarked schemes The certification categories under benchmarked schemes are explained in the GLOBALG.A.P. Benchmarking Regulations. REGISTRATION PROCESS Certification bodies/ farm assurers 1 The applicant chooses a GLOBALG.A.P.-approved certification body (CB) – contact information on approved and provisionally approved CBs is available on the GLOBALG.A.P. Web site; it is the responsibility of the applicant to verify whether the chosen CB is approved for the relevant scopes. The applicant must register with an approved CB or farm assurer as the first step towards obtaining a GLOBALG.A.P. certificate. Unless the applicant has specifically assigned a farm assurer, the CB is the farm assurer by default and is responsible for registration, data updates and collection of fees. Registration General The application must include the information detailed in Annex I.2 (GLOBALG.A.P. Registration Data Requirements), and registration automatically commits the applicant to comply with the obligations laid out therein, including: 1 GLOBALG.A.P.-approved farm assurers are organizations (producer group organizations, standard owners, consultants etc.) that have signed a license agreement with GLOBALG.A.P. and acquired the right from producers to upload and register these producer activities in the GLOBALG.A.P. database. The service includes the first registration and any subsequent modifications as well as settings of links in the database. The approved farm assurer must be granted these rights in writing from the producer or other legal entity in the GLOBALG.A.P. system. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 606 • compliance with certification requirements at all times; • payment of the applicable fees established by GLOBALG.A.P. and the CB; • communication of data updates to the CB; • compliance with the terms and conditions of the Sub-License and Certification Agreement. This information will be used by GLOBALG.A.P. to supply the applicant with a unique GLOBALG.A.P. number (GGN). The GGN identifies the applicant with regard to GLOBALG.A.P. activities and is not related to the product or certification status. Any objective evidence pointing to misuse of the GLOBALG.A.P. claim shall lead to the exclusion of the applicant from certification for 12 months. Such applicants will be listed and the list must be checked before registration in the database. Any case of misuse shall be communicated to GLOBALG.A.P. members. Confidentiality, data use and data release • During registration applicants give written access to FoodPLUS2 and the certification bodies to use the registration data for internal processes and sanctioning procedures. • All data in the GLOBALG.A.P. database is available to GLOBALG.A.P., the certification", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for Greenhouse Vegetable Crops", "org": "FAO", "year": "2013", "file": "FAO_GAP_Greenhouse_Veg_Crops.pdf.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The GGN identifies the applicant with regard to GLOBALG.A.P. activities and is not related to the product or certification status. Any objective evidence pointing to misuse of the GLOBALG.A.P. claim shall lead to the exclusion of the applicant from certification for 12 months. Such applicants will be listed and the list must be checked before registration in the database. Any case of misuse shall be communicated to GLOBALG.A.P. members. Confidentiality, data use and data release • During registration applicants give written access to FoodPLUS2 and the certification bodies to use the registration data for internal processes and sanctioning procedures. • All data in the GLOBALG.A.P. database is available to GLOBALG.A.P., the certification body and the farm assurer with which the producer or producer group is working, and can be used for internal processes and sanctioning procedures. • Minimum and obligatory data release level for all sub-scopes (and scopes for aquaculture): GGN, registration no., GLOBALG.A.P. certificate no., scheme, version, option, CB, products and status, produce handling/ processing declaration, number of producers (for groups), country of production and destination, production management units and produce handling units, information on parallel production and harvest exclusion per product (if applicable) are available to the public. Every certificate holder’s company name and address is available to registered industry market participants including GLOBALG.A.P. members. • If an applicant (or group member) does not agree to the minimum release, it is in breach of the Sub-License and Certification Agreement and cannot be certified, nor may it belong to a producer group seeking certification. • No data (other than that specified above) may be released by GLOBALG.A.P. or CBs to any other party without the written consent of the applicant. 2 FoodPLUS GmbH is a German limited company set up to act as the Secretariat for GLOBALG.A.P.; it ensures independence in the operation of GLOBALG.A.P. standards and is a not-for-profit company. 21. Labelling and certification: integrated farm assurance 607 • Information on the sector-specific requirements is included in the Data Use and Release Agreement on the Web site. The service contract between the CB and producer may be valid for up to 4 years, with subsequent renewal for periods of up to 4 years. An applicant: • may not register the same product with different CBs. • may not register the same product under different certification options. • may register different products with different CBs and different certification options (e.g. it is possible to register apples under Option 1 and cherries under Option 2, apples with one CB and cherries with another, or both crops with the same CB.). • may not register production management units (PMU) or group members in different countries with any CB (the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat may grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis or within national interpretation guidelines). The PMU is a production unit (farm, field, orchard, herd, greenhouse etc.) defined by the producer for units where segregation of output (agricultural products) is intended and all provisions have been made and put in place to keep separate records and prevent mixing in the case of parallel production. PMUs that can be considered to operate independently (based on factors such as geography, management and storage facilities) shall be registered in the GLOBALG.A.P. database and indicated on the certificate. Registration with a new CB When a producer that has already been registered changes CB or applies to a new CB for certification of a different product, the producer must communicate the GGN assigned by GLOBALG.A.P. to the new CB. Failure to do this will result in a surcharge of the registration fee of € 100 to an Option 1 producer and € 500 to an Option 2 producer group. Certificate holders who are sanctioned cannot change CB until the outgoing CB closes out the corresponding non-conformance or until the sanction penalty period is over. Individual producer members of a producer group are not allowed to leave the group and register with another group (for the products registered) if there is any pending sanction on the producer issued by the group, or there are any issues relevant to the producer raised by the CB that have not been closed out.

Web site). The registration and acceptance process must be finalized before inspection can take place. For first registration, the CB shall confirm the acceptance of the application and provide the applicant with the GGN within 14 calendar days of receipt of the completed application. Application and certification scope Any producer of primary agricultural products covered by GLOBALG.A.P. standards may apply for GLOBALG.A.P. certification. For GLOBALG.A.P. certification, the term “producers” is defined as follows: a person (individual) or business (individual or producer group) who is legally responsible for the production of the products relevant to the scope, and who has the legal responsibility for the products sold by that farming business. Standards covered by GLOBALG.A.P. certification • Only products covered by the GLOBALG.A.P. product list, published on the GLOBALG.A.P. Web site, can apply for certification. • GLOBALG.A.P. certification covers the controlled production process of primary products and does not cover wild/catch, wild fish/catch or crops harvested in the wild. • Refer to the standard-specific rules (published with the CPCC) for possible exceptions to the General Regulations contained in this document and for new standards released. All standards Producers cannot receive certification for products not produced by them. Parallel production/ownership (of certified and non-certified products) is possible when additional rules are implemented. Integrated farm assurance: fruit and vegetables GLOBALG.A.P. certification covers fruit and vegetables used for fresh, cooked or processed consumption by humans. Vegetables used solely for medicinal or aromatic purposes cannot be certified. 21. Labelling and certification: integrated farm assurance 609 Note that other standards are certified (e.g. combinable crops for cooked or processed consumption by humans or animals or for use in the industry, flowers and ornamentals, livestock scope, plant propagation material, compound feed in manufacturing and aquaculture scope). Applicable CPCC scopes and modules in integrated farm assurance It is not possible to certify the respective sub-scope without also verifying compliance to the applicable scope. The inspection of compliance criteria of the scope must be interpreted according to the sub-scope applied for. Any certification applied for that introduces additional sub-scopes into an existing certificate must have the scope inspected, taking into account the additional sub-scopes concerned. The scopes are automatically coupled to the sub-scopes according to the choice of sub-scopes applied for. For more information on the structure and modular approach, read the introduction to the CPCC document. Burden of proof If information concerning a GLOBALG.A.P.-certified-producer with a potential impact on the certified status or claim (e.g. MRL exceedance, microbial contamination) is transmitted to the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat, it is the responsibility of the producer to refute the claim by verifying and providing evidence for compliance with the GLOBALG.A.P. standard: • If the CB conducts the investigation, the findings and actions taken will be reported to the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat. • If the retailer or owner of the product conducts their own investigation, they shall report the findings back to the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat who in turn will ask the CB to take appropriate action. • GLOBALG.A.P. will give the producer a certain amount of time to do this. • If the CB does not deem the evidence supplied by the legal entity (producer or produce handling unit, PHU) adequate, the CB will issue a sanction and follow the normal sanctioning procedures as described in GLOBALG.A.P. General Regulations. • Producers must have full traceability in place – this could include mass balance, chain of custody certification and any other records needed to verify and check the case. Should the evidence include laboratory analyses, accredited laboratories (ISO 17025) and independent sampling (according to the rules as set out in the relevant CPCC) must be included.

GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 610 ASSESSMENT PROCESS In order to achieve certification, a registered party must perform either a self- assessment (Option 1 and Option 1 multisite without QMS) or internal inspections (Option 1 multisite with QMS and Option 2) and receive external inspections by the chosen certification body. Option 1 – single sites and multisites without QMS This section is applicable to applicants that are single legal entities (individual producer or company) with single production sites (farm) or multiple production sites that are not separate legal entities and are all centrally managed by the applicant. Table 1 presents a summary of the assessments to be undertaken before a certificate is issued (initial evaluation) and annually thereafter (surveillance evaluations). Self-assessments The self-assessment shall: • cover all sites, products and processes under the certification scope and comply with the requirements set in the applicable control points; • be the responsibility of the producer; • be carried out at least annually before the initial or surveillance inspections against the complete checklist (Major and Minor Musts and Recommendations) of all relevant scope(s) and sub-scope(s) and registered areas; the completed checklist must be available on site for review at all times; • record comments and positive findings during the self-assessment as described by the checklist. External inspections The inspection (announced and unannounced) shall be carried out by a CB inspector or auditor. The CB shall inspect the complete checklist (Major and Minor Musts and Recommendations) of the applicable scope(s) and sub-scope(s). Announced inspections Each applicant shall undergo one announced external inspection at the initial assessment and thereafter once a year.

Announced inspection of entire scope (all registered sites) 2. Unannounced inspection of (minimum 10% of certificate holders) 21. Labelling and certification: integrated farm assurance 611 The inspection shall cover: • all accepted products; • all registered production locations; • all registered product handling sites (in IFA). External unannounced surveillance inspections The CB shall carry out unannounced surveillance inspections on a minimum of 10 percent of all producers certified under Option 1. Unless the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat has approved a shortened checklist, the CB shall inspect the Major and Minor Musts of the applicable scope(s) and sub-scope(s). Any non-compliance will be handled in the same way as for non- compliances found during an announced inspection. The CB will inform the producer in advance of the intended visit; notification will not normally exceed 48 hours (2 working days). If impossible for the producer to accept the proposed date (for medical or other justifiable reasons), the producer will have one more opportunity to be informed of an unannounced surveillance inspection. The producer shall receive a written warning if the first proposed date is not accepted; the producer will then receive another 48-hour notification of a visit; if this visit cannot take place for non-justifiable reasons, a suspension of all products will be issued. Option 2 and Option 1 multisite with QMS This section is applicable to groups and individuals with multiple sites who have implemented a QMS and who comply with the requirements laid down in Part II of the General Regulations. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that all producers and PMUs under the certification scope comply with the certification requirements at all times. The CB does not inspect all producers or PMUs, but just a sample. Thus it is not the responsibility of the CB to determine the compliance of each producer or PMU (this responsibility rests with the applicant). The CB must assess whether the applicant’s internal controls are appropriate.

Internal assessments The applicant shall undertake internal assessments of all producers and PMUs to ensure compliance with the certification requirements. Internal assessments shall comply with requirements laid down in Part II and include: • a minimum of one internal audit of the QMS carried out by the internal auditor before the first CB audit and thereafter once a year; GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 612 • a minimum of one internal inspection of each registered producer/PMU and PHU (produce handling unit) carried out by the internal inspector before the first CB inspection and thereafter once a year; • self-assessments by each member of the group (but only if an internal requirement – it is not a GLOBALG.A.P. requirement). External quality management system (QMS) audit The audit (announced and unannounced) shall be carried out by a CB auditor (see CB auditor requirements in Part III of General Regulations). The audit (announced and unannounced) shall be based on the QMS checklist available on the GLOBALG.A.P. Web site. QMS announced audits The CB shall carry out one announced external audit of the QMS at the initial assessment and thereafter once a year. QMS unannounced surveillance audits The CB shall carry out additional QMS unannounced external audits on a minimum of 10 percent of the certified producer groups and multisites annually. Non-compliance detected will be handled as for an announced audit; non- conformances will lead to a sanction applied to the whole group or multisite. The CB will inform the certificate holder. This notification will normally not exceed 48 hours (2 working days) in advance of the intended visit. If it is impossible for the certificate holder to accept the proposed date (for medical or other justifiable reasons), the certificate holder will receive one more chance to be informed of an unannounced surveillance inspection. The certificate holder shall receive a written warning if the first date is not accepted. The certificate holder will receive another 48-hour notification of a visit.

The minimum number of producers/sites to be inspected during a certification cycle shall be equivalent to the square root of the current number of producers/ sites (grouped by type of activity). The inspections shall be divided in two: 50% unannounced during the validity period of a certificate (12 months); the other 50% during the announced surveillance inspection. Only if the producers inspected externally have no other sanctions raised in that surveillance inspection, the following regular announced inspection by the CB will be reduced to the square root of the current number of producers/PMUs minus the number of producers/PMUs inspected unannounced (providing the findings from the QMS audit carried out at the following regular announced inspection are also favourable to this reduction). Before a certification decision can be made, the square root of the total number of current producer members and PMUs must have been inspected in the previous 12 months. CERTIFICATION PROCESS Explanation of terms • Non-compliance (of a control point): A GLOBALG.A.P. Control Point in the checklist is not fulfilled according to the Compliance Criteria (e.g. the producer does not comply with the Minor Must AF). • Non-conformance (of the GLOBALG.A.P. Certification Rules): A GLOBALG.A.P. Rule necessary for obtaining the certificate is breached. • Contractual non-conformances: An agreement signed in the contract between the CB and the producer related to GLOBALG.A.P. issues is breached. GAPs for greenhouse vegetable crops: Principles for Mediterranean climate areas 614 CCPCC Requirements to achieve and maintain GLOBALG.A.P. Certification Control Points and Compliance Criteria consist of three types of control points: Major Musts, Minor Musts and Recommendations. In order to obtain GLOBALG.A.P. certification, the requirements are as follows: • Major Musts: 100% compliance of all applicable Major Must and QMS control points is compulsory. • Minor Musts: 95% compliance of all applicable Minor Must control points is compulsory. • Recommendations: No minimum percentage of compliance. Comments shall be supplied for all non-compliant and not applicable Major and Minor Must control points. In addition, comments shall also be supplied for all Major Musts, unless otherwise indicated on the checklist. This is obligatory for internal as well as external assessments. For example, a producer seeking certification for fruit and vegetables needs to comply with 100% of applicable Major Musts and 95% of the applicable Minor Musts of the All Farm (AF), Crops Base (CB) and Fruit and Vegetables (FV) modules combined. Certification decision The CB shall make the certification decision within a maximum of 28 calendar days after closure of any outstanding non-conformances. Any complaints or appeals against CBs will follow the CB’s own complaints and appeals procedure, which each CB must have and communicate to its clients. Should the CB not respond adequately, the complaint can be addressed to the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat using the GLOBALG.A.P. complaints extranet, available on the GLOBALG.A.P. Web site (www.globalgap.org). Sanctions Sanctions shall be forced as described below: • When a non-conformance is detected, the CB shall apply a sanction (Warning, Suspension of a product or Cancellation). • Producers are not permitted to change CB until the non-conformance which led to the respective sanction is satisfactorily closed out. • Only the CB or the producer group which issued the sanction is entitled to lift it; it may only do so if there is sufficient and timely evidence of corrective action. 21. Labelling and certification: integrated farm assurance 615 GLOBALG.A.P. certificate and certification cycle A certificate is not transferable from one legal entity to another if a production unit changes legal entity: an initial inspection is required. The certification cycle is 12 months in accordance with any sanctions or extensions (under certain conditions it is possible to extend the certificate validity to 4 months). Maintenance of GLOBALG.A.P. certification The registration of the producer and the proposed products for the relevant scopes must be reconfirmed with the CB annually before the expiry date.

Hydroponics as an advanced technique for vegetable production: An overview NISHA SHARMA1, SOMEN ACHARYA2*, KAUSHAL KUMAR3, NARENDRA SINGH4 and O.P. CHAURASIA5 Received: 03 July 2018; Accepted: 29 November 2018 ABSTRACT Currently hydroponic cultivation is gaining popularity all over the world because of efficient resources management and quality food production. Soil based agriculture is now facing various challenges such as urbanization, natural disaster, climate change, indiscriminate use of chemicals and pesticides which is depleting the land fertility. In this article various hydroponic structures viz. wick, ebb and flow, drip, deep water culture and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system; their operations; benefits and limitations; performance of different crops like tomato, cucumber, pepper and leafy greens and water conservation by this technique have been discussed. Several benefits of this technique are less growing time of crops than conventional growing; round the year production; minimal disease and pest incidence and weeding, spraying, watering etc can be eliminated. Commercially NFT technique has been used throughout the world for successful production of leafy as well as other vegetables with 70 to 90% savings of water. Leading countries in hydroponic technology are Netherland, Australia, France, England, Israel, Canada and USA. For successful implementation of commercial hydroponic technology, it is important to develop low cost techniques which are easy to operate and maintain; requires less labour and lower overall setup and operational cost.

The term Hydroponics was derived from the Greek words hydro’ means water and ponos’ means labour and literally means water work. The word hydroponics was coined by Professor William Gericke in the early 1930s; describe the growing of plants with their roots suspended in water containing mineral nutrients. Researchers at Purdue University developed the nutriculture system in 1940. During 1960s and 70s, commercial hydroponics farms were developed in Arizona, Abu Dhabi, Belgium, California, Denmark, German, Holland, Iran, Italy, Japan, Russian Federation and other countries. Most hydroponic systems operate automatically to control the amount of water, nutrients and photoperiod based on the requirements of different plants (Resh, 2013). Due to rapid urbanization and industrialization not only the cultivable land is decreasing but also conventional agricultural practices causing a wide range of negative impacts on the environment. To sustainably feed the world’s growing population, methods for growing sufficient food have to evolve. Modification in growth medium is an alternative for sustainable production and to conserve fast depleting land and available water resources. In the present scenario, soil less cultivation might be commenced successfully and considered as alternative option for growing healthy food plants, crops or vegetables (Butler and Oebker, 2006). Agriculture without soil includes hydro agriculture (Hydroponics), aqua agriculture (Aquaponics) and aerobic agriculture (Aeroponics) as well as substrate culture. Among these hydroponics techniques is gaining popularity because of its efficient management of resources and food production.

Water or nutrient solution supplied to plants through capillary action. This system works well for small plants, herbs and spice and doesn’t work effectively that needs lot of water. Ebb and Flow system This is first commercial hydroponic system which works on the principle of flood and drain. Nutrient solution and water from reservoir flooded Fig. 1. Diagram of various structures of hydroponic system 366 SHARMA et al. [Journal of Soil & Water Conservation 17(4) through a water pump to grow bed until it reaches a certain level and stay there for certain period of time so that it provide nutrients and moisture to plants. Besides, it is possible to grow different kinds of crops but the problem of root rot, algae and mould is very common (Nielsen et al., 2006) therefore, some modified system with filtration unit is required. Drip system The drip hydroponic system is widely used method among both home and commercial growers. Water or nutrient solution from the reservoir is provided to individual plant roots in appropriate proportion with the help of pump (Rouphael and Colla, 2005). Plants are usually placed in moderately absorbent growing medium so that the nutrient solution drips slowly. Various crops can be grown systematically with more conservation of water. Deep water culture system In deep water culture, roots of plants are suspended in nutrient rich water and air is provided directly to the roots by an air stone. Hydroponics buckets system is classical example of this system. Plants are placed in net pots and roots are suspended in nutrient solution where they grow quickly in a large mass. It is mandatory to monitor the oxygen and nutrient concentrations, salinity and pH (Domingues et al., 2012) as algae and moulds can grow rapidly in the reservoir. This system work well for larger plants that produce fruits especially cucumber and tomato, grow well in this system. Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system NFT was developed in the mid 1960s in England by Dr. Alen Cooper to overcome the shortcomings of ebb and flow system. In this system, water or a nutrient solution circulates throughout the entire system; and enters the growth tray via a water pump without a time control (Domingues et al., 2012). The system is slightly slanted so that nutrient solution runs through roots and down back into a reservoir. Plants are placed in channel or tube with roots dangling in a hydroponic solution. Although, roots are susceptible to fungal infection because they are constantly immersed in water or nutrient. In this system, many leafy green can easily be grown and commercially most widely used for lettuce production. BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF HYDROPONICS Recently hydroponic technique is becoming popular because this is clean and relatively easy method and there is no chance of soil-borne disease, insect or pest infection to the crops thereby reducing or eliminating use of pesticides and their resulting toxicity. Besides, plants require less growing time as compared to crop grown in field and growth of plant is faster as there is no mechanical hindrance to the roots and the entire nutrient are readily available for plants. This technique is very useful for the area where environmental stress (cold, heat, dessert etc) is a major problem (Polycarpou et al., 2005). Crops in hydroponic system are not influenced by climate change therefore, can be cultivated year-round and considered as off season (Manzocco et al., 2011). Further, commercial hydroponic systems are automatically operated and expected to reduce labour and several traditional agricultural practices can be eliminated, such as weeding, spraying, watering and tilling (Jovicich et al., 2003). Hydroponics saves large amount of water as irrigation and other kind of sprays is not needed and water logging never occurs. The problem of pest and disease can be controlled easily while weed is practically non-existent. Higher yields can be obtained since the number of plants per unit is higher compared to conventional agriculture. Although soil-less cultivation is an advanta- geous technique but", "meta": {"title": "Hydroponics as an Advanced Technique for Vegetable Production", "org": "Journal of Soil and Water Conservation", "year": "2022", "file": "Hydroponics as an advanced technique for vegetable production Journal of Soil and Water Conservation.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Higher yields can be obtained since the number of plants per unit is higher compared to conventional agriculture. Although soil-less cultivation is an advanta- geous technique but some limitations are significant. Technical knowledge and higher initial cost is fundamental requirement for commercial scale cultivation (Resh, 2013). Plant in a hydroponics system is sharing the exact same nutrient, and water borne diseases can easily spread from one plant to another (Ikeda et al., 2002). Hot weather and limited oxygenation may limit production and can result in loss of crops. Maintenance of pH, EC and proper concentration of the nutrient solution is of prime importance. Finally, light and energy supply is required to run the system under protected structure. pH AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY (EC) MANAGEMENT Plant nutrients used in hydroponics are dissolved in water and are mostly in inorganic and ionic forms. All 17 elements essential for plant growth are supplied using different chemical combinations. Hoagland’s solution is used as most common nutrient solutions for hydroponic systems. HYDROPONICS: A PROGRESSIVE TECHNIQUE 367 October-December 2018] Cooper’s 1988 and Imai’s 1987 nutrient solutions were also used for growing leafy vegetables, tomatoes and cucumber. Proper pH and EC of the nutrient solution is very essential and should be maintained properly for optimum plant performance. Optimum range of EC and pH values for different hydroponic crops is shown in Table 1. Ideal EC range for hydroponics for most of the crops is between 1.5 and 2.5 dS m-1. Higher EC will prevent nutrient absorption due to osmotic pressure and lower level severely affect plant health and yield. So, appropriate management of EC in hydroponics technique can give effective tool for improving vegetable yield and quality (Gruda, 2009). As an example, yield of tomato under hydroponic system increased as EC of nutrient solution increased from 0 to 3 dSm-1 and decreased as the EC increased from 3 to 5 dS m-1 due to increase of water stress (Zhang et al., 2016). Level of EC @1.5, 2 and 3 dS m-1 at vegetative, middle vegetative and generative phase, respectively had increased crop height, fruit number and pepper fresh weight. In a nutrient solution, pH determines the availability of essential plant elements. Optimum pH range of nutrient solution for development of plants is 5.5 to 6.5 (Trejo-Tellez and Gomez, 2012) for most species but some can differ from this range. Once the plants grows, it will change the composition of nutrient solution by depleting specific nutrients more rapidly than others, removing water from the solution and altering the pH by excretion of either acidity or alkalinity. Wang et al. (2017) found that mixture of three (HNO3, H3PO4 and H2SO4) acids was much more effective than only single acid for maintaining an optimal solution pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Change in pH may cause nutrient imbalance and plant will show some deficiency or toxicity symptoms. Hence, care is required for maintaining optimum pH, EC and nutrient level in hydroponic solution. Crops such as vegetables, spices, flower and ornamentals, medicinal plants, fodders and up to some extent cereals can be raised through soil less hydroponic technique and is mentioned in Table 2. PERFORMANCE OF VEGETABLES UNDER HYDROPONICS SYSTEM A large number of plants and crops or vegetables can grow by hydroponics system. Quality of produce, taste and nutritive value of end products is generally higher than the natural soil based cultivation. Various experimental findings outlines that leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, parsley, Table 2.

[Journal of Soil & Water Conservation 17(4) celery and atriplex etc) can be successfully and easily grown in hydroponic systems. Lettuce and spinach are most promising species to grow in integrated hydroponics and aquaculture systems because of its higher growth and nutrient uptake capacity. Hydroponic research on lettuce, spinach and other leafy vegetables Life cycle of hydroponic lettuce is very short compared to traditionally grown lettuce. Hydroponic lettuce can be harvested after 35 to 40 days of production. Lettuce can be successfully grown in NFT system and more than 8 crops per year can be grown efficiently in this system. Horizontal and vertical hydroponic system was also evaluated with different nutrient solutions for yield optimization of lettuce (Touliatos et al., 2016). Growing of lettuce in recirculating hydroponic system at spacing of 50 plants m-2 significantly increased yield and yield components (Maboko and Plooy, 2009). Frezza et al. (2005) found that there is significant difference in productivity and nitrate content of lettuce in both soil less (floating system and substrate culture) and soil culture however, other traits like leaf area, dry weight and ascorbic acid content were remain unaffected. In non circulated and non-aerated system, air space between nutrient solution and tank cover also determines optimum lettuce yield. Another study observed that marketable yield, shoot biomass and leaf area index of lettuce grown in floating system was not affected by nutrient solution composition (Fallovo et al., 2009). In other experiment, it was observed that both the hydroponic and organic system perform equal in terms of lettuce yield, quality and nitrate content, whereas, delayed harvesting not only increased yield but lower down nitrate level and reduced health hazards. Besides lettuce, recently various hydroponic experiments were conducted using spinach as model crop. Ranawade et al. (2017) have compared spinach yield in hydroponic, aquaponics and in traditional system in which perlite (aquaponics) and sphagnum moss (hydroponics) were used to support the plants. The yield of the aquaponically cultivated spinach was slightly more than hydroponically cultivated spinach. The results of Mwazi et al. (2010) showed that salinity has negative impact on vegetative growth, but spinach has some tolerance to saline water with 5 ppt. When spinach grown in floating system, lack of aeration and hypoxia was not severe enough to influence yield and yield component as spinach is short duration crop but quality somehow was affected (Lenzi et al., 2011). Hydroponic swiss chard when grown in gravel film technique, plant density of 40 plant m-2 and 14 days of harvesting interval improved crop yield, leaf area, biomass and leaf fresh weight (Maboko and Plooy, 2013). Contrary to this, hydroponically grown swiss chard, lettuce and sweet basil contain high mineral content, high root/shoot ratio, low level of nitrates, than grown in soil culture, however, their nutrient uptake and yield was lower (Bulgari et al., 2016). Effectiveness of rice husk biochar alone and in combination with perlite as substrates was also evaluated in NFT system for growing crops like cabbage, red lettuce, dill and mallow (Awad et al.,", "meta": {"title": "Hydroponics as an Advanced Technique for Vegetable Production", "org": "Journal of Soil and Water Conservation", "year": "2022", "file": "Hydroponics as an advanced technique for vegetable production Journal of Soil and Water Conservation.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Tomato and pepper grown under hydroponics system Many hydroponic systems can be used for growing tomatoes but NFT and deep flow technique (DFT) are commonly used system for successful tomato production. Growing of tomato in NFT system with regular recycling of nutrient solutions improved growth, productivity and mineral composition whereas, in NFT with prolonged recycling of nutrient solution yield was reduced (Zekki et al., 1996). Open and closed hydroponic systems were evaluated for perfor- mance of various cultivars of tomato and in closed system higher marketable yield was obtained as because of fruit cracking, yield was reduced in open system (Maboko et al., 2011). Schmautz et al. (2016) compared yield, quality and overall tomato plant vitality in three different systems of hydroponics (NFT, drip system and floating raft) system. Researchers also investigate effects of plant population, pruning and plant growth regulators on yield and quality of hydroponically grown pepper in various systems. Effectiveness of different substrate (vermiculite + sand, Peat + perlite, rockwool) were evaluated on growth and yield of hydroponically grown green pepper and reported that peat + perlite had most significant effect on growing traits and yield of green pepper (Majdi et al., 2012). Besides tomato and pepper, cucurbits viz. cucumber, cantaloupes are successfully grown in various hydroponic systems. Experiments were conducted on cucumber for optimization of salinity level, EC and nutrients in various hydroponic. NFT system was found to be most suitable for growth and productivity of cantaloupe. Apart from HYDROPONICS: A PROGRESSIVE TECHNIQUE 369 October-December 2018] vegetables, nowadays strawberry and different cut flowers are commercially grown under various hydroponic systems. WATER CONSERVATION IN HYDROPONIC As water becomes scarce and important as a resource, the use of hydroponics and other water saving technologies for crop production is needed now and is poised to popularize in time. Hydroponics uses substantially less water as compared to the soil farming. In soil farming, most of the water that we supply to the plants gets leached deep into the soil and is unavailable to the plants roots, whereas in hydroponics, plant roots are either submerged in water or a film of nutrients mixed in water is constantly encompassing the root zone, keeping it hydrated and nourished. Water is not wasted in this process, as it gets recovered, filtered, replenished and recycled. Waste nutrient solution can be used as an alternate water resource for crop cultivation under hydroponic system (Choi et al., 2012). Savings in irrigation water, fertilizer and increase in vegetable and water productivity under hydroponic system as compared to conventional agriculture is depicted in Table 3. NFT based hydroponics can reduce irrigation water usage by 70% to 90% by recycling the run-off water. It is possible to effectively grow high value, good- quality vegetables under controlled hydroponic conditions using 85 to 90% less water than tradi- tional soil based production. Water sources from groundwater or dam/river water commonly contain factors that can influence plant yield and affect plant condition, including salinity, dissolved solids and pathogens. While some of these factors can be beneficial to crops, others need to be minimised. GLOBAL HYDROPONIC MARKET AND COMMERCIAL HYDROPONIC PRODUCTION The Global Hydroponics Market has been estimated to cross USD 21203.5 million in 2016. By crop type, global hydroponics market includes tomato, cucurbits, lettuce & leafy vegetables, peppers and other food crops. Tomato forms the largest market segment and it accounts for 30.4% share of the global market, during 2018. Hydroponics crop production is expected to be more in tomatoes, lettuce and other leafy vegetables. As the consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the superiority of quality greenhouse-grown vegetables, the demand for hydroponics culture is rising in Europe and Asia- Pacific. Europe is traditionally the largest market that is implementing advanced techniques in hydroponics. Asia-Pacific forms the second largest market for hydroponics, which is expected to grow at a steady pace.

Asia-Pacific forms the second largest market for hydroponics, which is expected to grow at a steady pace. Leading countries in hydroponic technology are Netherland, Australia, France, England, Israel, Canada and USA. Dutch are the world leader in commercial hydroponic having total area of 13000 ha under tomato, capsicum, cucumber and cut flowers (Netherlands Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, NDEFRA) and this account 50% of the value of all fruits and vegetables produced in the country. Australian hydroponic production of vegetables, herbs and cut flowers of system valued about 300- 400 million dollar which is approximately 20% of the total values of vegetables and cut flower production in Australia reported by Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC). Australia is the largest hydroponic lettuce producers in the world, and having strawberry cultivation is larger than USA and cut flower production is almost equal to USA. Canada and Spain are also expanding the area under commercial hydroponic system. Japan has started rice production by hydroponics technique to feed the people (De Kreij et al., 1999). Israel grows large quantities of berries, citrus fruits and bananas in the dry and arid climate. Currently, demand of hydroponics cultivation has been increased in all the developing and developed countries (Trejo- Tellez and Gomez, 2012). In India, several tracts of wastelands having poor quality soil but plenty of Table 3.

[Journal of Soil & Water Conservation 17(4) water can be brought under hydroponics. Now a day’s peoples in various big cities like Delhi, Chandigarh, Noida and Bangalore are growing some leafy greens and small herbs and spices on their roof tops and balconies for fresh consumption. The future for hydroponics appears more positive today than any time over the last 50 years. The startup costs to implement a hydroponic farm can vary widely but, they are usually higher than soil- based farming costs. Therefore, to foster the hydroponics industry’s growth, it is important to implement technologies that reduce dependence on human labour and lower overall startup costs. CONCLUSIONS In recent years hydroponics is seen as a promising strategy for growing different crops. As it is possible to grow short duration crop like vegetables round the year in very limited spaces with low labour, so hydroponics can play a great contribution in areas with limitation of soil and water and for the poorer and landless people. In India, the hydroponic industry is expected to grow exponentially in near future. To encourage commercial hydroponic farm, it is important to develop low cost hydroponic technologies that reduce dependence on human labour and lower overall startup and operational costs.

Introduction Sustainable agricultural practices safeguard the food supply and the land, and ensure global food security by addressing the challenges posed by climate change. Hydroponic, is an alternative agriculture production system that focuses on climate resilience, efficient resource utilization, and disease-free crop production [1]. In hydroponics, instead of soil, plants receive a nutrient-rich water solution directly, providing them with the essential elements they need for growth. This method has several advantages, including better control over nutrient levels, more efficient use of water, and the ability to grow plants in areas with poor soil quality [1–3]. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L) is a crucial agricultural crop used globally for its nutritional value [4]. Following wheat, rice, and maize, it is the fourth most significant agricultural commodity [5]. Potato is an annual herbaceous plant being cultivated in temperate climates. It was found to have originated in the Andean highlands of South America and belonged to the Solanaceae family. So far, it is regarded as one of the most valuable staple crops and vegetables since they are reasonably inexpensive to cultivate and are rich in nutrients. Fresh potatoes contain 75–80% water, 2.5–3.2% protein, 16–20% carbohydrates, 0.8–1.2% minerals, 0.6% crude fiber, 0.1–0.2% crude lipids, and specific vitamins. Despite its low protein content, it has a higher nutritious value than cereals [6]. Addi­ tionally, it includes amino acids such as isoleucine, leucine, and tryptophan [7]. The universal appeal and acceptance of potatoes across cultural boundaries suggest that may play a role in the global effort to eradicate hunger. However, in order to meet the growing demands of a growing population, the production efficiency must be increased.

The universal appeal and acceptance of potatoes across cultural boundaries suggest that may play a role in the global effort to eradicate hunger. However, in order to meet the growing demands of a growing population, the production efficiency must be increased. In many countries, the price of cultivating seed tubers might make up as much as half of the total cost of harvesting and processing, which poses a significant challenge to potato farming [8]. Mini tuber production is the fundamental approach for potato seed production since it relates the rapid multiplication of in vitro plantlets by nodal cuttings to the field for the multiplication of potatoes [9]. Mini tubers, which range in size from 5 to 25 mm, are harvested year-round. Rooted micro plants grow under optimum conditions to produce mini tubers and multiply over several generations to produce seed potatoes. Critical factors that can be modified during the mini tuber production phase include 1) the number of mini tubers per unit area, 2) the number of mini tubers per in vitro plantlet, and 3) mini tuber yield per plantlet, 4) mini tuber’s average weight, and 5) the yield per unit area of mini tuber [10]. In most developing countries, practitioners traditionally used varying growth media such as perlite mixtures, peat moss, or bare soil to cultivate mini potato tubers. The most significant limitation of using soil as a growing medium is the difficulty in managing weeds and disease prevalence [11]. However, the economic implications of soilless agriculture as a replacement are significantly raised because it decreases soil disinfection and boosts water usage efficiency [12]. Hydroponics, a soilless system, has recently attracted researchers to overcome the limitations faced in traditional soil-based cultivation since it can be used for the production of crops irrespective of soil environment. Hydroponic systems, other than providing disease-free mini tubers, can provide multifold yield of seed potato as compared to the conventional methods [13,14]. Accordingly, this review aims to analyze the quintessential questions surrounding hydroponic systems and identify prospects for their field use while considering what has recently been proved, keeping potato mini-tuber production in focus. From a scientific perspective, the paper interprets two factors (nutrients and substrate) that have been extensively studied but still need more inves­ tigation since this information is crucial for enhancing nutrient acquisition management in soilless systems. Additionally, smart agriculture may make it possible for farmers to use cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), nanoparticles (NPs), plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), and aeroponics [15]. 1.1. Transition from a soil-based to a soilless production system Drought, unpredictable weather, contaminated water sources, and undernutrition crops compelled producers to look for alter­ natives to soil-based agriculture (Table 1). In response, soilless agriculture, a revolutionary crop cultivation method, has been adopted by growers for the past few decades to overcome the shortcomings faced by soil-based cultivation [16]. In comparison to soil-based cultivation, the soilless technique is considered safer since it contains fewer or no soil-borne pathogens and pests. In the soilless system, cultivation occurs in a nutrient solution or a customized cultivation substrate, including minerals [2]. The cultivation depends on using proper equipment, and the crops that are produced may generate higher yields if the system is appropriately managed.

Soilless methods for producing potato mini tubers Utilizing a technique known as clonal multiplication, which involves repeatedly propagating a sample free of diseases, is the traditional approach to producing mini tubers (also known as pre-basic seed potatoes). Unfortunately, this method of producing potato seeds is time-consuming, costly, and ineffective at preventing or reducing the development of diseases in later generations [17]. Micropropagation with in vitro multiplication, either through plantlet regeneration or micro tuber formation, is a superior substitute to clonal multiplication [18,19]. Stem cuttings, tissue culture, and—more recently—hydroponics are used in micropropagation. This enables year-round production of pathogen-free micro tubers in large quantities. Similarly, mini tubers are produced in a controlled environment with the help of soilless substrates, beds, containers, and nutrient solutions (hydroponics). Fig. 1 contrasts the various mini tuber seed production processes. 1.2. Hydroponics systems: types and operational mode Hydroponics is a soilless agri-production system widely suitable for the cultivation of greenhouse crops. Hydroponics is one of the rapidly growing fields in agriculture and could be the alternate choice for sustainable agriculture. The world’s population is growing faster than ever before, and this has led to the development of hydroponics, a potential method of growing vegetables without soil in cities. Controlled conditions, nutrient substrate and solid support pave the way for the development of hydroponics systems across the world, even in agro-climatic zones. Commercial firms have recently cantered their efforts on hydroponics, which has risen fivefold in the last decade and has a global market value of up to $8 billion US dollars [20]. According to estimates, the global hydroponics sector is predicted to reach $17.9 billion by 2026 [21]. Environmental parameters such as dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentration, pH, and temperature typically affect the growth of hydroponic culturing plants; hence, sensors are necessary to monitor real-time measurements. Electrical conductivity sensors may be used to monitor nutrient concentrations because an increase in ionized nutrient content increases electric current [22]. Numerous crops have been produced via the hydroponic system in developed countries to fulfil customer demands. Researchers are concentrating their efforts on whole-plant potato physiology to optimize massive hydroponic systems used for commercial mini-tuber production, easing the gathering of physiological and anatomical samples for study. Hydroponic systems may be closed or open depending on the growth medium used and the mechanism of nutrient circulation. Closed hydroponic systems do not need a growth medium. However, nutrient imbalances may occur in this system as time progresses if not maintained appropriately [23]. Thus, hydroponic nutrient solutions must be examined regularly, which makes them challenging to manage due to the varying mineral components. Specifically, in potato cultivation, plants absorb significant potassium (K) amount from the nutrient solution, resulting in a disproportion in the solution’s potassium content [24]. In contrast, open systems continually recycle, monitor, and adjust nutrient concentrations. Fig. 1.

But, by increasing the wick count to eight, the average tuber weight increased. The results suggested that eight wick per box was optimum for the production of ‘Dejima’ seed po­ tatoes. In a study conducted by Kang and Han [26], ‘Dejima’ seed potatoes were grown in a wick hydroponic system, where the effect of nutrient solution, NPK fertilizer and control released fertilizers such as osmocote, multicote and Magamp K was tested on the pro­ duction of seed potato. The number of tubers per plant was observed to be the highest (3.25 tubers/plant) in Multicote (100 g/box) treatment, whereas the highest average tuber (38.4 g/tuber) was observed in the nutrient solution treated plants. In a wick hydroponic system, the yield of potato plug seedlings was studied by Kang [38]. Commercial growing mixtures such as Jeju scoria + cocopeat, Jeju scoria + perlite, perlite + cocopeat (1:1 or 1:2, v/v), perlite + peat moss, and perlite + peat moss were used to make nine different types of growing media. Among the media studied, the findings indicated that perlite + peat moss (1:2) and Jeju scoria + peat moss (1:2) were the most suitable for seed tuber development and growth using a wick culture technique. The prime factors for considering this hydroponics approach include operation without the involvement of pumps, electricity, or aerators with low maintenance. Furthermore, because it doesn’t rely on electricity for the transportation of nutrients, it can be used in places where electricity is a major concern [39]. The Wick system is appropriate for herbs, small plants and spices [23]. Even though the wick system is simple and affordable, nutrient recycling is impossible since water is transported to the plants by capillary action, either by open or closed circulation [39]. Limited oxygen access, slower growth rate, and easily prone to algal growth are the significant limitations to using this system in a wide range of commercial applications. Moreover, the system is suitable only for small-scale crops with extensive periods that cannot be cultivated [20]. Similarly, many plants may consume the nutrient solution before replenishing it with the wicks. So, cultivating plants that require a high amount of water is tedious [23]. 1.2.2. Drip system hydroponics Drip system hydroponics uses pipes, hoses, and a growing media to provide regular nutrition and watering (Fig. 2b). This tech­ nology is like drip irrigation in soil gardening, gaining popularity and becoming the industry standard in hot and dry locations. Long pipes and hoses irrigate crops, save water, and decrease evaporation. Using an automated timer, a pump distributes water or fertilizer solution to individual plants or pots [40]. Presently, Big Data and IoT (Internet of Things) are employed in smart farming to modernize conventional agricultural farming to conserve nutrients and water. Sensors could help in monitoring the parameters such as tem­ perature and soil moisture. Kumari [41] examined the effect of drip irrigation on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) water consumption efficiency, leaf area maximization, and yield. That research evaluated the efficacy of a tangible way of repeated water delivery by the drip irrigation system. Frequent watering with water ensured efficient water usage and minimized system water loss. Leaf area and yield were considerably more remarkable in this system. In a recent conducted by Bakr et al. [27], a comparison between drip hy­ droponic and aeroponic and optimization of water productivity was done in potato mini-tuber production. The aeroponic system was observed to be better in yield productivity of mini-tubers than the drip cultivation. A drip hydroponic system designed by Kusnierek et al.

[27], a comparison between drip hy­ droponic and aeroponic and optimization of water productivity was done in potato mini-tuber production. The aeroponic system was observed to be better in yield productivity of mini-tubers than the drip cultivation. A drip hydroponic system designed by Kusnierek et al. [3] resulted in the production of ~300% higher potato tuber than the conventional system. The mineral composition of hy­ droponically grown potatoes was found to be similar to the ones grown in the field and their finding also suggested the potential of drip hydroponics in biofortification of food crops.

Enough oxygen transfer favors crop cultivation in soil and hydroponic systems [39]. Recirculation of excess nutrients is also possible in this system. Crops like cucumbers grow very well in the drip irrigation system. Similarly, superior tomatoes and peppers typically grow higher in the drip system when compared to other systems because they provide enough stability [42]. The major limitation of the drip system includes being easily prone to algal growth and clogging, so regular cleaning is mandatory. 1.2.3. Ebb and flow (or flood and drain) hydroponics system It is considered a more popular system in which plants are kept in large grow beds, usually filled with growing medium. A pump generally coupled to a timer is used to accomplish this (Fig. 2c). The timer regulates the flow of nutrient solutions in the environment. If the timer puts the pump on, it allows the nutrient solution in the growth tray, and if it shuts off, it pumps the nutrient solution back into the reservoir. In this approach, one must rinse roots often for brief intervals. So, it is unnecessary to endure extended exposure to the water, and they may remain wet, ensuring they can breathe. Nevertheless, continual observation is necessary to monitor water flow to the system. Son et al. [43] analyzed the existing sub-irrigation systems for potted plants. Their study compared a diverse experimental setup, such as a wick system with the nutrient-flow and nutrient-stagnant wick system, with the Ebb and flow method. While the water content of the medium under the nutrient-stagnant system gradually climbed to over 40% without fluctuation, the water content under the nutrient-flow and ebb & flow systems showed fluctuations from 30 to 40% and from 50 to 60% (by volume), respectively. The evaporation rate was 50–70 % less in the nutrient wick when compared with other systems. No studies in literature were observed where ebb and flow hydroponic system was used for potato seed production. The ebb and flow system is affordable, enhances nutrient recirculation, and requires low maintenance. It is the preferred choice for growing celery and melons. The primary limitations include the formation of root rot and crop loss due to technical failure. In addition, it is easily prone to algal growth. In order to overcome this, the system can be improved, and the filtration unit can be incorporated [44]. S. Rajendran et al. Heliyon 10 (2024) e26823 7 1.2.4. Deep water cultivation (DWC) hydroponics system DWC is a modified hydroponic system with an air stone, reservoir, air pump, tubing, and floating platform [45]. This system in­ cludes a tank (generally called a grow tank) containing the nutrient solution and a pump to supply oxygen to the roots (Fig. 2d). In the presence of an air pump, more plants can be cultivated in a single grow tank. Plant roots usually float in nutritional solutions for water, oxygen, and nutrients [46]. Oxygen, pH, and fertilizer levels must be monitored to optimize salinity [47]. Fong and Ulrich [48] first conducted a deep water cultivation study on potato cultivation. In their study, seedlings were collected from certified white rose tubers and subjected to drying overnight before plantation 1 inch deep in flats containing alveolate. It was given a nutritional solution without potassium (K). Seedlings of uniform size were selected and transplanted outside in five-gallon pots containing 20 L of solution. The plant development was somewhat reduced in the potassium-deficient feed media. Meanwhile, adding potassium to the nutrition solution increased plant growth. The water culture approach proved effectiveness in studying potassium shortage symptoms in potato plants. Chang et al. [28] performed a comparison of potato seed tubers production in three different hydroponic systems, i.e. aeroponic (discussed later), aerohydroponic and deep-water culture. The aerohydroponic system was designed by maintaining the contact of the root to the nutrient solution in lower bed part while spraying the upper root part intermittently. The deep-water cultivation system showed a delayed tuberization in comparison to aeroponic and aerohydroponic cultivation.

The aerohydroponic system was designed by maintaining the contact of the root to the nutrient solution in lower bed part while spraying the upper root part intermittently. The deep-water cultivation system showed a delayed tuberization in comparison to aeroponic and aerohydroponic cultivation. The deep water culture was observed producing the highest number of tubers but the total tuber weight/plant was least among the three. In their conclusion, it was stated that small tubers (1–5 g) for plant propagation can be produced using the deep water culture. The system is reliable and cheap, and an air pump uninterruptedly supplies oxygen to the crop root zone. A simple experimental setup in plastic boxes, glass basins, ice boxes, and fish ponds is enough for crop cultivation. Deep water cultivation is best suited for producing cherry tomatoes, cucumber, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, spinach, and radish [49]. However, crop cultivation using this method has not been commercialized extensively because of a few limitations, such as contact area between air and water and oxygen transfer efficiency [50]. Moreover, a few parameters, such as concentration of the nutrients and oxygen, salinity, and pH, must be critically monitored to evade algal and mold growth in the reservoir [23]. 1.2.5. Nutrient film technique (NFT) hydroponics system NFT technique requires only a thin layer of solution at the bottom of a deep tank (a “film” in actuality; Fig. 2e). Consequently, the lower half of the roots will receive food and water, while the upper half will be allowed to breathe [51]. This technique is used when plants respond by producing roots that reach the film and then extend horizontally when it is initially produced. This system exposes the root surface to the air during nutrient solution circulation. The pump is generally in mode to monitor the nutrient solution constantly [47]. In a study conducted by Corrˆ ea et al. [29], the researchers compared the potato seed tuber production of Monalisa and Agata cultivars in NFT with traditional beds and pots methods. In terms of tubers/plant number in single and staggered harvest, the NFT system performed better statistically. In a single harvest the number of tubers in hydroponically grown seed potato plants was 147% higher than the bed and pot systems. Even in the staggered harvest, an increase of 286% in tubers was observed in the hydroponic plants as compared to the ones grown in beds NFT was used to examine the yield of potatoes [52]. “Denali and Norland” potato cultivars were grown in polyvinyl chloride trays using continuous flow nutrition film. Nutrient solution pH was automatically maintained, and water was manually added daily, while nutrients were supplied twice a week. Each tray had one or two 112-day plants. As a result, Denali plant trays produced 2850 and 2800 g of fresh tuber weight, respectively. Tican [30] compared mini-tuber development in two industrial substrates (perlite and expanded clay) and two hydroponic systems (wilma and NFT). The NFT was observed having positive results in terms of minituberization, mini-tuber number and weight. Medeiros et al. [53] conducted an experimental study using different NFT systems to produce seed tubers and highlighted the significant advantages and drawbacks. The first method dealt with the aid of deep channels of 6 cm, roofing with asbestos made of polyethylene membrane, spaced each other by 18 cm, and placed on a wooden platform with a slope of 4%. The second method was the same as the previous method, with asbestos roofing overlapped with PVC channels. These two strategies were tested for the potato growth of pre-basic seeds. The study revealed that a greater multiplication rate was achieved by this technique when compared with other methods. The NFT hydroponic system enhances the recirculation of excess solution of nutrients and aids in the proper oxygen supply. Also, it is economical since it can be organized in multilevel, matrix farming, and vertical orientation. In addition, it minimizes land usage, labor and fertilizers compared to other systems. Water consumption is also very minimal, and it is climate resistant. It is most suitable for smaller and fast-growing plants such as lettuce [54] and is the most preferred technique for the cultivation of tomatoes.

Despite the fact that NFT is one of the most widely used hydroponics techniques, a lot of studies are concerned that exposing tuber roots to an excessive amount of salt from the nutrition may harm their periderm tissue. Thus, aeroponics has been promoted and applied in an effort to boost productivity. 2. Aeroponics: a modified version of hydroponics to grow mini tubers Plants produced by aeroponics thrive in an air or thick fog environment (Fig. 2f). It involves spraying a nutrient-rich water solution onto the plant’s hanging roots [55]. Lower stems occur in a closed or semi-closed environment using a high-pressure sprayer with a micro inject nozzle and an electronic timer [56]. It provides highly oxygenated nutrients to the plants. However, it is essential to customize the misting cycles for plants since their roots are exposed to the air and will dry rapidly. In addition, outside temperatures can easily affect the mist and make the system more challenging to operate in frigid conditions [57]. Several countries (including South S. Rajendran et al. Heliyon 10 (2024) e26823 8 Korea, New Zealand, China, Africa, Spain, and Latin America) have used aeroponics to grow mass amounts of potato mini-tubers. Aeroponics started with complicated equipment and relatively low yields, but by 2006, the International Potato Center (CIP) had improved the yields and made aeroponics work in developing countries [58]. Aeroponics is the future of soil-free agriculture. Growing tubers and rhizomes in an aeroponic system have the potential to be more profitable than growing them in a hydroponic or soil system. Mini-tubers cultivated aeroponically are also harvested differently than those grown conventionally. The fundamental distinction is in the sequential harvests of aeroponic plants. There is only one final harvest in the conventional system, while depending on the cultivar, up to ten or more harvests are possible using aeroponics. A competent aeroponics system may produce 100 tubers per plant [59,60]. Aeroponics is the most popular hydroponics system in the world. Its application in tropical regions such as Brazil has attracted much attention since it improved the production of virus-free seed potatoes [33]. This approach is the most popular alternative for potato seed growing in the highlands; nevertheless, in the lowlands, implementation is one of the most significant restrictions due to high temperature, which affects the commencement and growth of the tuber. Sumarni et al. [61] conducted a complex investigation on the cultivation of potatoes utilizing aeroponics and the root zone cooling method in the lowlands. Approximately 579 tubers per square meter and a height of 115 m above sea level were recorded at 10 ◦C using this method [62]. In a study by Brocic et al. [34], five virus-free potato cultivars were grown using a substrate system, an aeroponic system, and a combination of the two systems. Mini tubers output by plants cultivated in an aeroponic system was 4.08 times higher than the substrate system and 1.29 times higher than the combination system, with the 16–19 ◦C optimum for initial growth and 18–22 ◦C for filling. Çalıs ¸kan et al. [14] in their evaluation of mini tuber production of three different cultivars in con­ ventional and aeroponic systems found the number of tubers per plant higher in aeroponic cultivation as compared The plant density was observed to be playing a major role in the tuber production, where with increasing plant density in aeroponic system, the number of tubers/plant was observed to reducing. The 200 plants/m2 plant density showed a mean tuber number in a range of 9.6–16.8 in three cultivars in two different cycles of plant growth, whereas 25–50 plants/m2 density showed 14.0–25.7 mean tuber number.

Feasibility of aeroponics farming to support potato cultivation irrespective of agroecosystem. S. Rajendran et al. Heliyon 10 (2024) e26823 9 mini-tubers by Factor et al. [31], the aeroponic system was observed to be producing the highest mini-tubers per plant (49.3/plant) as compared to the deep flow technique (41.6/plant) and NFT (39.5/plant). However, the hydroponic system did not appear to have any effect on the longitudinal diameters or fresh weights of the tubers. In a further study by Factor et al. [32], the same observations were made where the aeroponic system was observed showing best results among the three types of hydroponic systems. In Uganda, Kakuhenzire et al. [35] found that aeroponics increased potato mini tuber output by 8.5 times than the conventional cultivation. Small tubers per plant determined multiplication rates. Low plantlet density resulted in high mini-tuber output. In another study, Calori et al. [33] studied the role of electrical conductivity (EC) on nutrient intake and growth of Agata and Asterix potato varieties. Potato seedlings were seeded in phenolic foam and then aeroponically. To follow tuber initiations, air temperature, growth cycle, shoot development, and mini tuber output of both cultivars during different seasons, electrical conductivities (1, 2, 3, and 4 dS m−1) and planting densities (25, 44, 66, and 100 plants m−2) were evaluated. Both cultivars had optimal ECs below 2.1 and 1.7 dS m−1, respectively. The selected cultivars responded economically at 100 plants m−2. Several African nations also employed aeroponics to develop potato micro tubers [63]. It produces more flavonoids, phenolics, and antioxidants than soil cultivation and minimizes the amount of water potato plants need and ensures they get enough oxygen [64,65]. Aeroponics farming requires less water and no soil, so it is a prudent option for promoting mini tuber production in challenging potato cultivation environments, such as deserts, cold steep terrains, and coastal regions. Mini potato tubers grown in an aeroponic system can either be transported to an adjacent open field, or the technique can be utilized for crop production in hostile environments. Aeroponics systems don’t need fertile land to be installed, and closer plant spacing is possible. This has led to the emergence of intriguing ideas about growing crops on space stations, sailing ships, and extraterrestrial colonies (Fig. 3). Recently, Klarin et al. [66] presented an intriguing design for a marine aeroponic infrastructure that can enable the production of mini tubers on huge ships utilizing solar and wind power. Aeroponics-based crop production in interplanetary colonies or space stations may soon be the subject of enthralling research projects [67]. However, the technology is still in its infancy and has room for development. The system still requires a good environment and appropriate techniques, and hence more elaborative research is warranted. For example: • Optimizing nutrition solutions for various potato cultivars. • Identifying the local nutrient source to reduce input costs. • Cost-benefit analysis to determine the practicality of aeroponics systems for the generation of mini tubers in developing nations Nevertheless, aeroponics can become a technology that contributes to global food security with adequate planning, research funding, and the incorporation of advancements (described in the following section). 2.1. Technological advancements in hydroponics Industrialization is changing the face of agricultural advancements just as it does to the rest of society. As a result of hydroponics technology, it is possible to produce food crops in harsh environments such as hilly areas too high to cultivate, concrete school playgrounds, and arctic settlements. Beyond staple crops and vegetables, hydroponics may also produce specialty crops like salad leaves, spices, and ornamental plants in urban locations where land prices have replaced conventional farming [68]. Artificial lighting, agricultural plastics, and pest and disease-resistant cultivars will enhance crop yields and cut production unit costs. Rahman et al. [69] examined the effects of artificial LED light on potato pre-basic seed tuber production in their study. In their observations, the red + far red light combination was seen to enhance the overall potato plant growth.

In their observations, the red + far red light combination was seen to enhance the overall potato plant growth. Different artificial light combinations positively affected the number of seed tubers, fresh tuber weight, photosynthetic pigment accumulation, carbohydrate and sucrose content. Different studies have confirmed the positive influence of using artificial light in hydroponic and aeroponic potato mini-tuber production, which can be harnessed for better yield and cost reduction by optimization of these systems [69–72]. Waste heat from industry and power plants is now used in hydroponic greenhouses as an emerging trend to enhance energy efficiency [73]. Since the hydroponics system utilizes only water and nutrient solution without the involvement of soil, any failure or problem in the nutrient distribution, water pump, or nozzle clogging will lead to rapid death of the growing plants. Special attention is required to ensure real-time monitoring of the growth and development of the plant. As described below, hydroponic systems may benefit from including a few new features (Fig. 3). 2.1.1. Sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time monitoring Precision agriculture, a newer concept known as smart agriculture, uses cyber-physical techniques to combine information and communication technology (ICT) in all phases of the farm management cycle [74]. Sensors and data analysis tools can be used throughout the culture for real-time plant growth monitoring. Robots using position-based visual feedback could improve smart hydroponic farming [75]. Smart hydroponics might help find the best way to grow a plant by combining hardware setup with a software tool replicating the plant’s growth trajectory [56]. Nutrient and light sensors are now used in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted hydroponics [76]. One can gather information via sensors installed in the gadget to gather data—for example, shifts in temperature, humidity, and light intensity. When the AI computer visualizes the developing plant’s colors, it identifies the parameters to be executed, like providing nutrients to the soil based on the specific colors upon recognition. The parameters of hydroponic solutions may be self-calibrated and managed using machine-learning algorithms based on sensor data [77]. The AI system directly delivers the nutrient solution, water, and light to plant roots using sensors. However, as sensor technology develops, more data is being created, making it challenging to utilize them correctly. S. Rajendran et al. Heliyon 10 (2024) e26823 10 2.1.2. Nanoparticles Nanoparticles (NPs) are used in agriculture to increase nutrient management and crop production. Due to their large surface area and relevant reactivity, NPs offer the plant readily accessible nutrients by enhancing the soluble and available forms of nutrients [78]. Precipitation and insolubilization processes are often related to bulk fertilizers. The use of nanoparticles as a delivery mechanism promises to be significantly more efficient than current approaches [79–81]. Nanoparticles have been shown to alter critical responses in plants, such as germination, seedling vigor, root development, and photosynthesis [82,83]. Additionally, several studies revealed that nanoparticles might provide plants with a better defense against oxidative stress since these particles can imitate antioxidant enzymes, viz., superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase [84]. It has been shown that nanoparticles can be used to reduce the impacts of temperature, salt, and drought stress on plants by enhancing their tolerance to these stresses [85]. Benefits arising from this technology are relevant not only for soil but also for soilless systems. Nanoparticles were utilized in hydroponics systems to accelerate the development of various plants such as spinach and tomato [86]. The introduction of nano­ particles produced promising plant growth and disease resistance outcomes. In a study conducted by Homaee and Ehsanpour [87], the effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) or silver nitrate (AgNO3) on in vitro culture of potato plants were investigated. It was observed that growth parameters, such as leaf area, root length, shoot dry weight, and root dry weight, increased in the plants treated with AgNO3 and AgNPs. Plants treated with AgNO3 or AgNPs at two mg/L had significantly more chlorophyll than control plants. All in­ dicators exhibited substantial growth and pigment differences treated with nanoparticles except for shoot length. Since nanotechnology is still in its infancy, close attention needs to be paid to the toxicity and trophic transmission of nanoparticles in our surroundings.", "meta": {"title": "Exploring Innovative Sustainable Hydroponic Technologies", "org": "Heliyon (Elsevier)", "year": "2021", "file": "Hydroponics Exploring innovative sustainable technologies Heliyon.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

To wrap things up on a bright note, recent studies have found that potatoes have far more nano Iron, Calcium, and Zinc than they did a few years ago. This can result in lower rates of disorders such as iron deficiency anemia in less economically developed nations. Recent interest has been focused on Engineered Nanoparticles because of their diminutive size [88]. Silicon (Si) increased crop output when foliar-sprayed as nanoparticles under varied conditions, including salinity [89], toxic heavy metals [90], and drought [91]. In a study by Saadian et al. [92], nano and ionized Si derived from sodium silicate were examined at concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 3.2 mmol Si L−1. In that investigation, 3.2 mmol Si L−1 was determined to be the ideal concentration. In com­ parison with treatments employing ionized Si, nanoparticle Si yielded superior results. The application significantly increased photosynthetic and biochemical indices. Additionally, it improved water use efficiency. 2.1.3. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) PGPR are bacteria that may enter plant roots after being injected onto the seed and stimulate plant development. They inhabit rhizospheres and rhizoplanes in nature. PGPR enhance the bioavailability of mineral nutrients in the rhizosphere by stimulating a variety of processes such as atmospheric N2 fixation, P solubilization, and siderophores production for Fe3+ chelation [93–96]. It can act as a biocontrol agent and a nutrient-fixing organism. Therefore, adapting such microbes to a hydroponics system can potentially boost productivity and reduce the cost of nutrients in the case of potato mini tuber. Several beneficiary microorganisms were reported for the plant’s growth in the hydroponics system. Results revealed that sig­ nificant differences occur upon treatments with plant growth-promoting bacteria. Table 3 highlights the beneficiary microorganisms used for plant growth in a hydroponic system. 3. Conclusion and perspective Mini tuber production is a standard technique for propagating or acclimating in vitro material before its application in the field. Traditional methods (soil-based) of cultivation need more heightened monitoring and micromanagement. Low mini tuber multipli­ cation rates are a further disadvantage of this production method. In recent years, hydroponic systems have emerged as incredibly successful approaches to raising potato mini tubers. Very high rates of tuber multiplication, no concerns of tuber contamination by soil pathogens, and reduced frequency of physiological disorders are only a few of the many benefits connected with hydroponics in producing mini tubers. The nutrient film technique, deep flow cultivation, and recently, aeroponics are being exploited for growing potatoes. Although aeroponics resulted in a significant increase in tuber yield relative to other methods now in use, additional work is required to refine the technology and promote its widespread adoption. It includes the development of protocols for location-specific cultivars, the examination of correlations between production components, and the standardization of plant densities, harvest Table 3 Beneficial microorganisms and the host plant interaction in a hydroponics system.

It can be hypothesized that these technological advancements in aeroponics and hydroponics will present countless opportunities to increase food security, particularly important for farmers who usually farm less than 2 ha of land. Developing such sophisticated soil-less farming has, therefore, allowed for a wide variety of research, raising expectations that can help nourishing the next generations. It should be no surprise that the hydroponics/aeroponic system is the most promising method for mass-producing mini tubers in any environment that humans can access, i.e., land, water, or space.

An agricultural area of 593 hectares of land is required to feed the population. Present agriculture faces the huge task of satisfying the demand and it can nowhere match reaching the demand for food worldwide in future decades. The prime challenge in basic practices are climate calamities along with soil fertility issues, excessive water, and nutrient requirements. Hence Technology must permeate the Agricultural sector to explore innovative alternative sustainable methods as solutions against food insecurity, resource conservation and to mitigate the negative impacts on the Ecosystem. Hydroponics is a new sustainable method of soilless farming in controlled Environmental conditions producing high-quality yields of crops. Index Terms: climate calamities, Food security, sustainable, high yield, resource efficient, optimum fertilizer, Agriculture 4.0. 1. INTRODUCTION This article discusses scope, methods, advantages, limitations, potential and possibilities, setup factors, challenges, costs vs benefits, and future research in the field of Hydroponics. Basically, it is a subset of horticulture which is based on hydroculture, HYDRO means water and pono means labor. This unique innovative grow system controls the balance of nutrition, humidity, and temperature and uses a ten percent fraction of water than conventional methods, producing a High qualitative yield. The plants grow faster and healthier since the nutrients are delivered to their roots through water in the form of an aqueous solution. The major risk of climate calamity in unconventional farming is mitigated by meticulously controlled micro environmental conditions for plant growth. 1.1 METHODS Elements of photosynthesis like Sunlight, water nutrients, and Carbon Dioxide are artificially substituted by tailor-made LEDs and soil-free mediums like coco peat, rice husk, perlite, sand, gravel, vermiculite, rock wool, etc. Proper drainage, aeration, recirculation and water-holding capacity provide moisture to plants and facilitate nutrient movement to roots. Multiple forms of hydroponic methods are emerging as media culture and solution culture. Circulating methods like NFT, DWC, Dutch bucket system, Aeroponics and Aquaponics, etc are in common practice. The poly houses and technologies adopted range from basic low tech design models to fully automated high tech systems. Farm settings and size can be categorized as indoor , outdoor , community and commercial application setups. International Journal on Science and Technology (IJSAT) E-ISSN: 2229-7677 ● Website: www.ijsat.org ● Email: editor@ijsat.org IJSAT25025317 Volume 16, Issue 2, April-June 2025 2 1.2 ADVANTAGES High-yield, healthy, clean, and pest-free, eco-friendly crops are produced with less labor and space. Since the roots do not take up much room, more crops are produced on a given surface. Seeds do not need to make their way through the soil mechanically hence allowing for faster maturation and crop development leading to short cultivation cycles. Ensure food security in extreme drought areas and areas of low soil quality. Abandoned lands and landfills can be reverted as natural ecosystems, food parks, and vertical gardens. As against conventional farming, they use fewer resources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprint, and agricultural waste without use of fertilizers . 1.3 LIMITATIONS Lack of Educational awareness and training in the agricultural sector and heavy investments may lead to intense risks. Maintenance and monitoring of sensors and digital systems need expertise, skill, and support. Financial support from governments and subsidies given is too less for the set-up costs. Technical know-how standards, and knowledge are the roadblocks of this promising urban farming. Plumbing systems and automation, such as sensors, controllers, water pumps, lighting, Consultant’s fees, and equipment to control temperature, and purify water all need installation and maintenance costs. Generating plant nutrition and integration of Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics is a real challenge. 2.0 POTENTIAL AND POSSIBILITIES Hydroponic modular farming can be used to grow the following.

This technology eliminates the need for soil and reduces water usage by providing nutrients straight to the plant's roots. The Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and automation are all used in \"smart farming,\" which allows for constant monitoring of soil conditions, nutrient levels, and plant vitality to facilitate fine-grained management and optimization. The technology-driven strategy improves crop output, quickens growth rates, and keeps conditions ideal all year round regardless of weather or other environmental circumstances. In addition, smart farming lessens the need for organic chemical inputs, promotes environmentally safe methods of pest management, and minimizes the amount of waste produced. This ground-breaking strategy may significantly alter the agricultural sector by encouraging regionalized food production, enhancing food security, and adding to more resilient farming practices. This comprehensive review delves into current trends in Hydroponics, highlighting recent advancements in smart farming systems, such as Domotics, Data Acquisition, Remote Cultivation, and automated AI systems. The review also underscores the various types and advantages of smart farming hydroponic technology, emphasizing the requirements for achieving efficiency in this innovative domain. Additionally, it explores future goals and potential developments, paving the way for further advancements in hydroponic smart farming.

While the concept of soilless growing has been around for millennia, the modern hydroponic system was developed in the middle of the 20th century as a solution to boost food production in locations with limited resources and space [5]. It is believed that the Hanging Gardens were created utilizing the first known application of hydroponic cultivation [6]. To prove that plants might grow successfully without soil, a Flemish botanist named Jan van Helmont undertook experiments in the 17th century. Later, in 1800, French scientists De Saussure and Boussingault proved that plants require carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen for proper growth. Subsequently, in 1860, German scientists Sachs and Knop added to De Saussure and Boussingault's list by cultivating plants in aqueous solutions including salts of phosphorus, sulphur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium [7, 8]. William Frederick Gericke is often cited as an early proponent of growing plants without soil. Because ISSN 0973-2063 (online) 0973-8894 (print) ©Biomedical Informatics (2023) Bioinformation 19(9): 925-938 (2023) 927 he believed it would be more efficient and successful, Gericke focused on developing methods for cultivating plants without soil. Using lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers as examples, he conducted a slew of experiments demonstrating that plants could grow and flourish in nutrient-rich water so long as their fundamental nutritional demands were met. The concept of soilless agriculture owes a great deal to Gericke's research, which also laid the framework for modern Hydroponics [9]. Hydroponics is now widely utilized in commercial and domestic settings to cultivate various products, from leafy greens to tuber crops to tomatoes and herbs. Its promise to boost food production and sustainability, decrease water consumption, and raise crop yields has recently increased in popularity [10]. Importance and relevance of Hydroponics in urban farming: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization's report in 2001, it is projected that the global population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050. This will require a 60% rise in the production of food worldwide. The current state of under nourishment has found to affect around 11% of the global population, and there has been an upward trend in this figure in recent times. As though, food security has emerged as a prominent concern in the current era, representing a critical challenge for the agricultural sector [Tilman, 2002] [11-13]. Furthermore, the number of malnourished individuals stands at approximately 690 million. According to research, livestock farming utilizes around 80% of the global agricultural land, necessitating significantly more land than plant-based food farming. According to research, approximately 30% of the global food supply is wasted annually [14]. According to recent data, most of the world's population resides in urban areas, surpassing the number of individuals living in rural regions. Specifically, in 2018, cities accommodated 55% of the global population [15]. According to another study, the percentage of the global population residing in urban areas was 30% in 1950 [16]. However, projections indicate that by 2050, this figure is expected to increase to 68% [17]. Even though, urban populations have been rapidly increasing, nevertheless, agriculture has been able to meet their growing demands by producing food that requires higher energy, land, water, and generates increased greenhouse gas emissions. The primary concern lies in whether agriculture can sustainably keep up with the changing demands of urban populations while also promoting agricultural prosperity and reducing poverty in both rural and urban regions [18]. When taking the perspective of urbanisation and limiting the poverty, focusing on smart farming is a far more effective way to reduce poverty than investing in other areas, as agriculture has given its pivotal role in a country's infrastructure and its potential impact on conflicts and wars which were driven by historical land-related food disputes [19]. Such that the expansion of urban areas creates competition for resources such as soil, water, and labour with agriculture. This could be attributed to the influx of people and the reclassification of land use [20]. The competition for limited resources has led to a situation where advanced agriculture is required to increase its productivity to addressing the issue on diminishing the burden of poverty chain and simultaneously combating demand of land and climate change concerns [21].

The competition for limited resources has led to a situation where advanced agriculture is required to increase its productivity to addressing the issue on diminishing the burden of poverty chain and simultaneously combating demand of land and climate change concerns [21]. Hydroponics, however, is a crucial feature of contemporary farming, especially in the context of \"smart farming.\" It offers some benefits and addresses serious problems with traditional agricultural methods. Hydroponics has several advantages over conventional agricultural techniques like using soil and greenhouses. Hydroponics allows for economical water consumption, typically using as much as 90% less water than conventional farming methods [22]. Hydroponics, with its carefully calibrated nutrient solutions, may produce far greater quantities of greens than conventional soil gardening [23]. Hydroponics also allows for greater crop output per unit area because of its vertical farming methodology, which makes the most efficient use of available space [24]. It was recorded that there was a significant decrease in photosynthetic photon flux density and shoot fresh weight in the Vertical Farming Systems [VFS] as the distance from the apex to the foundation increased. However, despite this reduction, the VFS generated a greater amount of crop per unit of cultivation space compared to the horizontal hydroponic system [25]. The study's findings indicate that VFS may be a viable substitute for horizontal hydroponic development mechanisms. Additionally, the study suggests that integrating artificial lighting into the VFS may lead to even higher yields. Pests and illnesses are less likely to be a problem with hydroponic systems, lowering the demand for chemical pesticides [26]. Finally, Hydroponics allows for continuous production throughout the year independent of external weather conditions, guaranteeing a steady supply of fresh vegetables [27]. Hydroponics often provides a better Return On Investment [ ROI] than conventional farming methods because of its greater productivity and quicker harvest times [28]. Research findings indicate that hydroponic lettuce production has the potential to generate significantly higher yields per acre in comparison to soil-based cultivation, with reported increases of up to 20 times. The enhanced productivity observed in hydroponic farming systems has been found to result in improved financial returns and a faster return on investment. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, hydroponic systems may increase lettuce yields by as much as 20 times per acre [29]. Brault et al., conducted a study on the year-round production of lettuce using the nutrient film technique in a greenhouse with artificial lighting to investigate the feasibility of using this technique to produce lettuce throughout the year, which involved the use of a greenhouse with artificial lighting to provide the necessary light and the nutrient film technique to provide the necessary nutrients to the plants. The study's findings indicated that hydroponic lettuce farming in a controlled environment enables uninterrupted and reliable year-round crop yield, thus surmounting any seasonal constraints [30]. By implementing a controlled environment and precise nutrient management, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of achieving uninterrupted tomato production regardless of external weather conditions, facilitating year-round market supply [31].

In another study, the research findings indicate that implementing hydroponic cultivation methods and regulated environmental factors enabled uniform strawberry yield, irrespective of seasonal constraints [33]. These benefits demonstrate the practicality and longevity of growing hydroponically-cultivated leafy greens. Advantages of hydroponic farming System: Resource Efficiency: The optimization of resources like water, nutrients, and space is a key benefit of Hydroponics. Hydroponic farming techniques have been found to reduce water usage by up to 90% compared to conventional soil-based farming. Additionally, this method allows for the recycling and reutilization of nutrient solutions, promoting sustainability and minimizing waste. The implementation of vertical farming techniques has been found to optimize space utilization, resulting in the ability to achieve high- density crop production [34].

Growers can utilize controlled environments to establish the ideal conditions for plant growth, encompassing temperature, humidity, light intensity, and nutrient concentrations. Maintaining a consistent and dependable food supply, decreasing reliance on imported goods, and improving food security are all important factors to consider [35]. Increased Crop Yields: Research has shown that hydroponic systems accurately regulate growth conditions, leading to increased plant growth rates and greater crop yields than traditional farming techniques. Research has shown that customizing nutrient delivery and optimizing the root zone environment can improve plant health and productivity. [36] . Environmental Sustainability: The utilization of Hydroponics has been found to reduce the adverse effects of agriculture. The elimination of soil dependency results in a reduction of soil erosion, loss of nutrients, and spoilage. Integrating Hydroponics with sustainable practices, such as organic pest control, water recycling, and renewable energy sources, can contribute to a more environmentally friendly approach to farming [37]. Nutritional Quality and Flavour: The precise control of nutrient levels and growing conditions in hydroponic cultivation can improve crop quality and flavour. Hydroponic cultivation can be particularly noteworthy for speciality crops, herbs, and medicinal plants due to the potential to optimize specific compounds and active ingredients. [38]. Pest and Disease Control: Hydroponics provides a soil-less environment, reducing the risk of soil-borne pests and diseases. Integrated Pest Management [IPM] techniques can be implemented more effectively in Hydroponics, utilizing biological controls and minimizing the need for chemical pesticides. This leads to healthier plants and safer produce [39]. Urban Agriculture and Local Food Production: Research suggests that Hydroponics is a suitable method for urban agriculture as it allows food production in confined spaces such as rooftops, vertical farms, or indoor facilities. Promoting local food production has been found to positively reduce transportation distances and improve access to fresh, regionally produced crops. Strengthening local involvement and knowledge about sustainable food systems is also observed [14]. Scientific Research and Innovation: Hydroponics is a platform for scientific research and innovation in agriculture. Researchers can explore new techniques, develop improved cultivars, and test novel approaches for sustainable food production. Integrating smart technologies, automation, and data analytics further advances the field and facilitates continuous improvements in hydroponic farming practices. Hydroponics is a game-changer in modern agriculture, offering increased efficiency, sustainability, and productivity. Its ability to overcome the limitations of traditional farming methods makes it a valuable tool for meeting the challenges of food security, environmental conservation, and the growing demand for nutritious and high- quality produce. Types of Hydroponic Systems: Hydroponic systems can be classified mainly into two based on the substrate used soilless-solution culture and granular-substrate culture Hydroponics [40]. Types of hydroponic systems that are in use today and their specification with the list of plants that grow best in them are tabulated (Table 1). Table 1: Types of Hydroponic systems and specific plants S.No Hydroponic System Characteristics Specific Plants Reference 1. Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) The roots of plants in NFT systems are constantly bathed in a thin coating of nutrient-rich water, from which they may draw the nutrients they need. The excess liquid is collected and subjected to a recycling process Leafy Greens, Herbs, Strawberries Beans Raddish, Cucumber [41] 2. Deep Water Culture (DWC): This involves the suspension of plant roots in a nutrient solution that is continuously oxygenated through an air pump. The roots of plants that remain submerged in water can absorb more nutrients and oxygen due to their prolonged exposure to the aquatic environment. The Dutch bucket system is a well-liked deep-water hydroponic system that offers a productive and regulated environment for plant growth. Individual buckets or containers filled with an inert medium, such as perlite or coconut coir, support the plants while enabling their roots to reach a nutrient-rich solution.

In this experimental setup, the plants are situated within an inert growing medium, and a wick composed of a cotton rope is employed to facilitate the upward movement of the nutrient solution from a reservoir to the root zone. Small Plants, Herbs, And Low-Nutrient-Demanding Plants [43] 7. Krakty method Among the other types of hydroponic methods, this system is much easier and cheaper; it does not require electronic devices and does not need electric current to operate. The entire crop needs an initial administration of water and nutrients, making the system an effective plant production method. The static, suspended-pot method is highly efficient for minimizing water wastage. Leafy Greens, Herbs [44] [ 45] Overview on Recent developments in Hydroponics: Innovative technologies, including smart home technology (domotics), IoT automated growing techniques, and AI-based systems, have increasingly entered the mainstream recently and, to add to that, have relevant applications in indoor hydroponic productions [46, 47]. The amount and accessibility of knowledge on the web means that increasing numbers of individuals are starting to explore these growth strategies for various motives, and both hydroponic and indoor cultures are growing in popularity with farmers [48]. Domotics for indoor cultivation- control tools: It is important to consider the concept carefully while establishing a facility for indoor production and hydroponic planting. Specifically, the spot, dimension, targeted plant species, and tools required for the particular task must be considered. A hydroponic farming system and an indoor conservatory must operate with various specialized gadgets. To provide the optimal climate for the growth of plants, we will consequently need lights with specialized ranges for horticulture, aspirators for the movement of air, humidifiers, fans, heat producers, etc. Thermo-hygrometers for determining both humidity and temperature, heating systems that regulate aspirators or cooling systems, and hygrostats to regulate humidifiers or dehumidifiers are a few control devices employed nowadays for improved and controlled production. However, advanced Software-based controls with programs that can handle information collected by sensors and regulate the operation of lights, aspirators, humidifiers, etc., through in-built applications to maintain stable every environmental condition are inadequate now. Data Acquisition for Cultivation: The effectiveness or lack thereof of the yield might be influenced by a wide range of internal and external elements, including conventional methods of manual monitoring and measurements, which tend to be ineffective and insufficient in various ways. In this time when information is easily accessible, sustaining the authenticity of the agricultural system depends on reliable information gathering and dissemination. These numbers and facts are statistics compiled to provide backed-up, empirical results that might greatly enhance yield quality [49]. As a result, farming will become increasingly data-driven and data-enabled. Even though machines do a sizable portion of processing work, individuals will still be engaged.

The technical developments brought about by globalization now include innovative agriculture. More automation and machine learning in farming are anticipated to result from new technologies like the Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing that could implement data and communication processes, increasing production [51]. Large firms and companies are anticipating that massive Data in Peta and Zeta bytes has an enormous opportunity to generate revenue in various manners [52]. The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes an interconnected system of objects, tools, automobiles, constructions, and other technological sensing devices, like software enabling the exchanging of data. This primarily includes Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and sensors. The fusion of the natural environment with computing devices and online resources offers valuable data and functionality for improved production [53]. In a study in 2017 to validate the effect of Internet of the Things on Smart Hydroponic Farming Ecosystem (HFE)\" sensors and relays were exploited efficiently. The authors incorporated the monitoring and regulating characteristics into their prototype design to validate variables for 27 days: temperature of air and water, moisture, pH level, electrical conductivity (EC), water height, flow rate and nutrient concentration. The Arduino 2560-based information recorder was developed to gather data from five sensors on six distinct variables and store it on an SD card to show system efficiency instantaneously [54]. Kyaw et al. designed a prototype utilizing sensors to collect data and actuators to regulate settings to validate aquaponics (growing fish with Hydroponics). They employed smartphone apps for quick systems management and cloud-based storage for their regression data assessment of fish and plant growth [55].

In broad terms, the Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) acquire data, while the master units analyze and execute commands based on the acquired information. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) operate by being configured to collect exact categories of data. Every device is designed to oversee particular elements of the agricultural land and transmit a notification to the central system in case of any deviation from the predetermined parameters [56]. Integration of IoT in Vertical Farming: Vertical farming is a popular trend in Hydroponics that involves stacking multiple layers of plants in a vertical arrangement. This farming method saves space, reduces water usage, and increases yields per square foot of growing area. In response to increased demand for agricultural productivity, vertical farming is a new technology that aims to boost crop yield per unit of land. VF is a technically challenging and pricey crop production method that uses protected horticulture systems like glasshouses and controlled environment facilities along with numerous layers of growth surfaces and/or inclined production surfaces. As a result, VF requires a scientific approach that considers various elements, including lighting, crop nutrition, growing systems, energy efficiency, construction, and site selection [9]. The Internet of Things (IoT)is used in vertical farming to monitor environmental conditions and collect data on individual plants. IoT systems use this information to formulate accurate recommendations for the amounts of light, water, and nutrients that should be provided to each plant. An IoT device prototype for smart vertical farming with LED lights, sensors, a wooden board, and a battery is presented in the International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology. The prototype is equipped with sensors such as a light-detection resistor (LDR), soil moisture sensor (SMS), and LM35 temperature sensor (TMS), which together gather data on plant development and then analyze and show that data in a web application for optimal efficiency [57]. Recently, there have been reports of a smartphone app developed in Android Studio that allows users to regulate and track plant development in hydroponic vertical farming systems.

Recently, there have been reports of a smartphone app developed in Android Studio that allows users to regulate and track plant development in hydroponic vertical farming systems. Using Internet of Things technology, sensors are used to monitor environmental and dietary factors including temperature, humidity, TDS, pH, and water level. The Thing-Speak cloud platform was then used to send the data. The Tashi Home Pindfresh system and Arduino and Raspberry Pi have been utilized as control centres [58]. Aeroponics Technology: Aeroponics is an indoor horticulture technique that suspends plant roots in a nutrient-rich mist, allowing maximum oxygenation and nutrient uptake. This highly efficient farming method can result in faster plant growth and higher yields. According to Martin-Laurent et al. (1999) [10], aeroponics technology is modern, relevant, and novel. For reforestation of damaged land in humid climates, it can cultivate plants in huge quantities and tree seedlings linked to soil microorganisms, such as AM fungi. Aquaponics: A sustainable hydroponics approach to the circular economy: It is the method of cultivating plants and animals [ often fish] close to one another. Bacteria convert noxious fish wastes like ammonia into plant-friendly nitrates and nitrites. Aquaponics relies on fish waste as its primary food supply; thus, understanding this concept is essential. In turn, the plants filter the water, making it safe for the fish. This approach is beneficial since it helps save money and biological resources by reducing waste [59, 60]. AI-Driven Hydroponics: Glenn Dbritto et al. have researched land and water conservation using an artificial intelligence system in the hydroponic cultivation of Tomato F1 hybrid Suhyana seed. The system provides a controlled environment where a combination of water, nutrient solution, and light is autonomously supplied to the plant roots. This approach aims to optimize plant growth while minimizing water usage and promoting sustainable land use practices [61]. A Deep neural network (DNN) was implemented in a study by Mehra et al., to regulate the hydroponic system's efficacy parameters (environmental conditions) [62]. Sensors linked to both an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi 4 have been integrated into a prototype indoor IoT-based hydroponic control system for the nutrient film technique; to automatically adjust and manage the nutrient and pH levels in the study system [63]. A recent study conducted by Sun Park involved the development and implementation of an integrated system that utilizes IoT-Edge-AI-Cloud to track environmental data in strawberry hydroponics to identify optimal harvest times. The monitoring system is suggested to gather, organize, and visualize data related to the circumstances in which strawberries are grown. Additionally, a deep learning algorithm was utilized to classify the maturity level of strawberries in images. An integrated interface was employed to visualize the monitoring and analysis results, offering fundamental data for strawberry cultivation. Authors demand that even if the area used for strawberry farming grows, the suggested system, which is based on a virtualized container and the IoT-Edge-AI-Cloud idea, may be readily scaled and flexible. The hydroponic strawberry atmosphere was monitored for 4 months to verify the effectiveness of the monitoring system. Furthermore, the verification of the harvesting was decided by utilizing strawberry images obtained from Smart Berry Farm [64]. Factors involved in an effective hydroponic system: Factors affecting seed germination and seedling establishment for hydroponics system: Regulated farming, specifically greenhouse food crop production, has been identified as a highly intensive form of cultivation that can effectively tackle the challenges of climate change, freshwater scarcity, and the increasing demand for food. The primary concern in the context of seedlings pertains to the challenge of insufficient germination and emergence. Controlling the factors that influence seed germination can improve crop development and reduce production costs by enhancing seed germination and emergence [65].

The germination of plant species is influenced by the temperature range that is most suitable for their growth. Research has shown that ensuring appropriate temperature conditions can enhance the speed and consistency of seed germination. Maintaining the appropriate temperature for specific seeds during germination in a hydroponic system is crucial to monitoring [66]. Light: The importance of light in the process of seed germination and early seedling development has been widely recognized in the field of plant research. It has been observed that the germination process of most seeds is triggered by exposure to light, while some seeds may require a period of darkness to initiate germination. The optimal intensity and duration of light are crucial factors in hydroponic systems. Artificial grow lights, such as LED or fluorescent lights, can provide the seedlings with the required light energy [66, 67]. Water and Moisture Hydroponic systems rely on water as the primary medium for delivering plant nutrients. Adequate water availability and moisture levels are critical for seed germination. Ensuring the seeds are consistently moist but not overly saturated is important, as excess water can lead to rotting or damping-off diseases. Maintaining an appropriate moisture balance in the growing medium is vital for successful seedling establishment. Wetting the chosen medium before planting the seeds is recommended without soaking it excessively. In order to achieve successful germination, it is crucial to maintain a consistent moisture level for the seeds. However, it is important to note that excessive water can impede the growth of the initial shoots and roots, ultimately hindering the establishment of the plant. It is also recommended to maintain a consistently moist environment for the medium during the germination process and the initial days following sprouting. Overwatering must be avoided to prevent medium saturation [68]. Oxygen Oxygen availability is a crucial aspect that affects seed germination and root development in hydroponic systems. The respiration process of seeds necessitates oxygen, and oxygen in the growth medium is a critical factor in ensuring the successful establishment of healthy seedlings. Using an inert growing medium, such as perlite, vermiculite, or rockwool, is common in hydroponic systems. This method facilitates optimal oxygen exchange. Adequate oxygen supply to the roots is crucial to nutrient solution aeration. [69, 70]. Nutrients: Although seeds possess certain nutrients to facilitate their initial growth, further nutrients are necessary for the healthy development of seedlings. A balanced nutrient solution is required in hydroponic systems, which should contain essential macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, along with micronutrients like iron, zinc, and manganese, in appropriate concentrations. Optimal seedling growth can be supported by ensuring a proper nutrient balance and maintaining the desired pH level of the nutrient solution [70]. pH Level: The measurement of acidity or alkalinity in a solution is commonly referred to as pH. Plants' optimal growth depends on their specific pH requirements, which vary among plant species. Maintaining an appropriate pH range within the nutrient solution is crucial for successful germination and establishment of seedlings in a hydroponic system. Research has shown that the optimal pH range for most plants is slightly acidic to neutral, with a range of approximately 5.5 to 6.5. Frequent monitoring and adjustment of the pH level in the nutrient solution is crucial in establishing an ideal growth environment for the seeds [70]. Seed Quality: The role of seed quality and viability is crucial in determining the success of germination. Using premium seeds from trustworthy sources enhances the probability of prosperous germination and seedling establishment. In order to maximize the germination potential of seeds, it is important to use fresh, disease-free, and properly stored seeds [71]. Effect of support system for plant growth in a hydroponic system: Rockwool: Rockwool has been identified as a commonly used growing medium in hydroponic systems. The material under consideration is produced by melting rock and spinning it into fibres. Its notable properties include high water retention capacity and adequate aeration. The use of Rockwool has been found to provide a stable structure for root development, which in turn promotes efficient nutrient uptake.

The use of Rockwool has been found to provide a stable structure for root development, which in turn promotes efficient nutrient uptake. The versatility and accessibility of this substance make it suitable for various plant species [72]. Coco coir: Using coco coir as a growing medium is a sustainable and eco-friendly practice, given that it is derived from coconut husks. The material under investigation exhibits favourable water retention characteristics and facilitates adequate aeration. The use of coco coir has been found to have a positive impact on root growth, as well as creating a favourable habitat for beneficial microbial activity. The capacity to buffer nutrient solutions is a recognized characteristic of the subject, which guarantees the appropriate nutrient supply to the plants [72]. Peat moss: Peat moss is a frequently utilized growth substrate in hydroponic systems. The material exhibits exceptional water-holding properties and demonstrates a high capacity for moisture retention. Improper soil management can lead to compaction, which can impede the growth of roots. The acidity of peat moss necessitates careful monitoring and adjustment of the nutrient solution's pH. Adding perlite or vermiculite is a common practice to enhance aeration in the medium [72]. Expanded clay pellets: The lightweight and aerating properties of expanded clay pellets, also referred to as hydroton or clay pebbles, are making them highly interested in the hydroponics field now. Additionally, these pellets have been noted to provide effective drainage. They exhibit a pH value of 7, indicating a neutral nature. Furthermore, it displays a notable resistance to degradation and does not undergo breakdown over extended periods. Using clay pellets is prevalent in hydroponic systems that operate through flood and drain (ebb and flow) mechanisms. Plant roots require stability and efficient oxygen exchange, which specific structures can facilitate. The water-holding capacity of these materials is limited, which may necessitate more frequent irrigation [72]. Sponge: Sponges and foam cubes have been identified as common support systems utilized in aeroponic or nutrient film technique (NFT) hydroponic systems. Providing a stable structure for seed germination and root development is crucial to plant growth and development. According to studies, sponges exhibit notable water retention capabilities and can retain nutrient solutions near roots. They also facilitate adequate aeration and prevention of waterlogging. The maintenance of sponges may necessitate meticulous observation to avoid desiccation or excessive saturation. Biochar: Biochar production involves subjecting organic matter to high temperatures in an oxygen-free environment, producing carbon-rich material with a porous structure. The material exhibits outstanding characteristics of water retention and aeration. Research has shown that applying biochar can enhance the capacity of the root zone to retain nutrients and promote microbial activity. Moisture regulation is one of the benefits of this technique, which also mitigates the risk of overwatering. The low nutrient-holding capacity of the soil may necessitate supplementary fertilization [73, 74]. Classification of Hydroponics based on the usage of substrates in the medium is listed in Table 3.

Which in turn can be broadly classified into macronutrients and micronutrients? The importance of both for the nourishment and growth of plants cannot be overstated. This includes macro-nutrients like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, calcium, and magnesium and micro-nutrients like iron, manganese, zinc, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, copper, and nickel. Plants acquire carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen through natural means, specifically from the air and water they consume, with the remainder obtained from the soil. The roots obtain nutrients from nutrient solutions or aggregate media in hydroponic systems. Research has shown that hydroponic systems are comparatively less tolerant than soil-based systems, and any issues related to nutrients can rapidly manifest plant symptoms. The criticality of the nutrient solution composition and regular monitoring of the nutrient solution and plant nutrient status is a significant aspect to consider. The major salt deficiencies that a hydroponic system may encounter include nitrogen, calcium, iron, magnesium, and boron deficiencies. The detrimental effects of soluble salts have been attributed to various factors, including but not limited to over-fertilization, suboptimal water quality, gradual accumulation of salts in the aggregate media, and inadequate drainage. Insufficient leaching during the process of fertigation in Hydroponics can lead to the accumulation of soluble salts in the medium due to water evaporation [75]. Nutrient antagonism and interaction is a crucial parameter that warrants serious consideration in the context of hydroponic systems. Research suggests that plants tend to absorb nutrients proportionally to their presence in the nutrient solution. The phenomenon of nutrient ISSN 0973-2063 (online) 0973-8894 (print) ©Biomedical Informatics (2023) Bioinformation 19(9): 925-938 (2023) 933 uptake in excess leading to a higher uptake of one nutrient at the cost of yet another has been observed and is classified as nutrient antagonism. The nutrient levels in the nutrient solution may not necessarily guarantee optimal plant growth and development. Despite sufficient nutrient supply, plant nutrient deficiency may still occur [75, 76]. Some major nutrients significance has been discussed below.

The nutrient levels in the nutrient solution may not necessarily guarantee optimal plant growth and development. Despite sufficient nutrient supply, plant nutrient deficiency may still occur [75, 76]. Some major nutrients significance has been discussed below. Nitrogen deficiency: In instances of nitrogen deficiency, the colour of leaves may change to a lighter shade of green or, in severe cases, a yellow hue. Observations can be made from stunted development and discolouration, specifically a slight purple tint, on the stems and undersides of leaves. Whereas if the feeding solution includes excessive nitrogen, roots become stunted, causing blossoming to be delayed [77]. Boron Deficiency: Boron deficits are rare and often accompany calcium shortages, mainly in the case of plant's deficit with water. Boron generally improves root uptake of potassium and phosphorus and keeps plant cell walls intact and functioning [78]. Xin Song and colleagues studied hydroponic sugar beetroot growth and yield to determine the impact of Boron (B) depletion. Sugar beetroot seedlings' SLW and root-shoot ratio increased after exposure to a Boron deficit for 14 days. Enzyme activities such as peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase have decreased due to this deficiency, whereas malonaldehyde and proline have increased. Oxidative stress was caused by the accumulation of ROS in plant cells and the subsequent loss of antioxidant enzyme performance. According to this research, a lack of boron can negatively impact a plant's development and structure [79]. Magnesium Deficiency: Hydroponic production requires a full hydroponic nutrient solution, which includes Mg as one of the key ingredients. Mg insufficiency can be made worse by nutritional inconsistencies. Magnesium (Mg) uptake can be blocked by certain ions, such as Ca and K. Higher levels of either Ca or K can inhibit Mg uptake; therefore, the standard goal ratio is 2:1 for Ca:Mg and 4:1 for K:Mg. Mg deficiency can also be caused by a few other, less frequent factors, including a cool root zone or a stunted root system due to illness or waterlogging. As Mg is poorly accessible at low pH (e.g., pH less than 5), a low substrate pH can also lead to Mg insufficiency [80]. However, in their study on cormrbid conditions of Mg deficiency in mulberry plants, Rajesh Kumar Tewari et al., has implicated the induction of oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in these plants due to Mg deficiency in a hydroponic condition oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in mulberry plants. They have also reported a significant decrease in H2O2 production in Mg deficit plants. Iron Deficiency: An alkaline soil growing system similar to that found in sugar beet fields was created by buffering the hydroponic medium with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to characterize iron deficiency. The study claimed that the in vivo ability for Fe3+-chelate decrease boosted substantially in both Fe efficient genotypes (NB1 and NB1xNB4) but less than two times in the Fe inefficient genotype (NB4). It was found that the distribution and period of enhanced Fe3+-chelate decline capacity were contingent on the Fe efficiency integrity of individual genetic makeup [81]. In another study, Low Fe levels influence pigment and micronutrient contents of chile pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) were studied through a hydroponic system. It was found that the total extractable pigments of red fruits and their surface colour remained unaffected by iron treatment. However, leaf Fe and Fe ++ were directly proportional to iron supplement, on the other hand, indirectly proportional to copper, phosphorus, and zinc concentrations in the leaf [82]. pH level of nutrient solution: pH indicates the solution's acidity or alkalinity. 0–14, with 7 neutrals. Maintaining nutrition solution pH levels in the optimal range increases nutrient availability. Soilless culture nutrient solutions should have a pH between 5 and 7 (typically 5.5) as they are weakly neutralized and needs automated pH adjustment to keep the root environment between 6 and 6.5 [83]. Even though Phosphorous (H2PO4 to HPO4) buffers pH, pH between 1 to 10 mM, it is harmful to plants. A circulating solution with around 0.05 mM has substantially less buffering power than the new replenishment mixture that replaces transpiration losses because plants actively absorb phosphorus [84]. Nutrients commonly employed in nutrient solutions of hydroponic growing systems, their functions, and the diseases associated with their deficiency in plants are tabulated in Table 4.

Through this process, plants convert light energy into chemical energy, which is then utilized to support their metabolic processes and promote growth. Artificial lighting systems such as LED lights can be utilized in smart Hydroponics to regulate light's intensity, spectrum, and duration meticulously. The optimization of light settings is a crucial factor in plant growth, as it enables growers to provide the appropriate amount and quality of light that is required for each growth stage. The light requirements of plants vary depending on the species, with some requiring specific amounts of red and blue light. Light regulation in smart Hydroponics is crucial for providing plants with adequate energy for photosynthesis, which leads to healthy growth, strong development, and enhanced yield [85]. Temperature: Temperature plays a significant role in plant growth and metabolic processes. In smart Hydroponics, the temperature can be precisely regulated to create an ideal plant environment. Each plant species has an optimal temperature range for growth and development, including germination, root growth, and flowering. Maintaining the appropriate temperature range can enhance enzymatic activity, nutrient uptake, and overall plant performance. Smart hydroponics systems often use sensors and automated controls to monitor and adjust temperature levels, ensuring that plants are kept within their preferred temperature range [85]. Humidity: The term humidity pertains to the quantity of water vapour in the atmosphere. The careful management of humidity in smart Hydroponics can lead to the creation of an optimal growing environment. The impact of high humidity levels on transpiration rates in plants has been studied, with findings suggesting potential benefits for certain plant species during the vegetative growth stage. Research has shown that high humidity levels can lead to the development of fungal diseases. Low humidity has been found to cause rapid moisture loss in plants, potentially resulting in water stress. Incorporating humidifiers, dehumidifiers, or ventilation systems in smart hydroponics systems enables the maintenance of accurate humidity levels. The manipulation of humidity levels by growers can facilitate an optimal environment for plants, fostering robust growth and mitigating the likelihood of pathogenic infections [86]. In smart Hydroponics, the ability to control and optimize physical factors gives growers greater precision and flexibility in creating an ideal growing environment. By fine-tuning light, temperature, and humidity, growers can mimic optimal conditions for specific", "meta": {"title": "Hydroponic System: Nutrient Management Research", "org": "National Institute of Horticulture (NIH)", "year": "2019", "file": "NIH Published Paper.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Research has shown that high humidity levels can lead to the development of fungal diseases. Low humidity has been found to cause rapid moisture loss in plants, potentially resulting in water stress. Incorporating humidifiers, dehumidifiers, or ventilation systems in smart hydroponics systems enables the maintenance of accurate humidity levels. The manipulation of humidity levels by growers can facilitate an optimal environment for plants, fostering robust growth and mitigating the likelihood of pathogenic infections [86]. In smart Hydroponics, the ability to control and optimize physical factors gives growers greater precision and flexibility in creating an ideal growing environment. By fine-tuning light, temperature, and humidity, growers can mimic optimal conditions for specific plant species, growth stages, and environmental preferences. This level of control allows for more efficient resource utilization, improved plant health, and, ultimately higher yields in hydroponic cultivation.

By harnessing these advantages, Hydroponics could offer a highly efficient and sustainable method of cultivation, enabling growers to maximize yields, optimize plant quality, and minimize environmental impact. Future Goal: Achieving 30% food sustainability by 2030 with only 1% arable land requires careful planning, innovation, and the implementation of various strategies. Some key considerations for achieving this goal include: Hydroponics in hospitals: Integrating mobile hydroponic systems in hospitals is a potential future direction for Hydroponics. This approach is considered innovative and can improve nutrition and patient care. Culturing high-value plants rich in essential nutrients, minerals, vitamins, and therapeutic compounds can improve the quality of meals in hospitals. This targeted nourishment may support patients' recovery and overall well-being. Integrating a mobile hydroponic system with vertical farming techniques can optimize cultivation in a small area, allowing for efficient use of space in various settings such as roof-top gardens, balconies, or dedicated indoor spaces. Implementing this approach guarantees an uninterrupted provision of superior plant specimens such as herbs, leafy greens, or medicinal plants. Using these plants in cooking, teas, or extracts can serve as a natural source of remedies and supplements for patients, which may aid in fulfilling their dietary needs. Hydroponics provides a controlled environment that enables year-round cultivation, reducing reliance on seasonal produce and potential supply fluctuations. Vertical Farming and Rooftop Gardens: Vertical farming and rooftop gardens should be extensively explored due to the limited availability of land. Vertical farming involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, enabling optimal utilization of space. Establishing rooftop gardens on buildings has been identified as a potential method for expanding areas available for food production. [87]. The practice of indoor agriculture: It encompasses greenhouse systems, can facilitate crop production throughout the year while safeguarding crops from unfavourable weather conditions. The practice of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) entails meticulously regulating environmental variables, including light, temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentrations, to facilitate the most favourable conditions for plant growth. Implementing CEA technologies has potentially improved productivity and resource efficiency", "meta": {"title": "Hydroponic System: Nutrient Management Research", "org": "National Institute of Horticulture (NIH)", "year": "2019", "file": "NIH Published Paper.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Implementing CEA technologies has potentially improved productivity and resource efficiency [88]. High-Yield Crop Selection: Hydroponic system studies emphasize the importance of prioritizing high-yield crops that can provide maximum output within a confined space. The prioritization of crops with shorter growth cycles, higher nutritional value, and greater demand is a crucial aspect of agricultural research. This study aims to investigate and determine appropriate crop cultivars that are well- suited for the climatic conditions of Singapore and can be cultivated effectively through hydroponic or other advanced agricultural methods. Efficient Resource Utilization: The optimization of resource utilization can be achieved by implementing smart irrigation systems, water recycling, and nutrient management strategies. Implementing techniques such as drip irrigation, fogging, or precision fertigation can reduce water and nutrient wastage. Research has shown that the implementation of recirculating hydroponic systems can result in a significant reduction in water consumption. Agro-technology and Automation: Implementing advanced agro-technology and automation can enhance productivity and decrease labour demands in the agricultural sector. The implementation of IoT-based systems, sensors, and data analytics are being researched to monitor and control environmental parameters, detect crop health issues, and optimize resource usage.

We evaluated three types of hydroponic systems-Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Deep Water Culture (DWC), and Aeroponics-in terms of plant yield, water usage, and energy consumption. The results indicated that Aeroponics consistently produced the highest yields across all locations, followed by NFT and DWC. This research underscores the potential of hydroponic systems to address urban food security and sustainability challenges in India, while highlighting the need for integrating renewable energy solutions to mitigate high energy consumption. Keywords: Systems, highlighting, beekeeping, need Introduction Urbanization in India is progressing at an unprecedented rate, leading to significant challenges in ensuring a sustainable supply of fresh produce to urban populations. Traditional agricultural practices face constraints such as limited arable land, water scarcity, and the complexities of long supply chains, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased carbon footprints. To address these challenges, hydroponic systems have emerged as a promising solution for urban agriculture. Hydroponics involves the cultivation of plants in a soilless environment, using nutrient-rich water solutions to deliver essential minerals directly to the plant roots. Hydroponic systems offer several advantages over traditional soil-based agriculture, including reduced water usage, higher crop yields, and the ability to grow plants in controlled environments. This technology is particularly relevant for densely populated urban areas where space is limited and soil quality may be poor. Moreover, hydroponics can contribute to urban food security by enabling local production of fresh vegetables and fruits, reducing the reliance on rural agricultural areas and decreasing the environmental impact associated with transporting produce over long distances. In India, cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru are experiencing rapid urbanization and an increasing demand for fresh produce. These cities present unique opportunities and challenges for implementing hydroponic systems. Delhi, with its hot summers and cool winters, Mumbai's humid tropical climate, and Bengaluru's moderate temperatures and high altitude, provide a diverse range of environmental conditions to test the efficacy of different hydroponic systems. This study aims to optimize hydroponic systems for high-density urban agriculture in these three cities, focusing on three popular hydroponic techniques: Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Deep Water Culture (DWC), and Aeroponics. NFT systems circulate a thin film of nutrient solution over the roots, ensuring a continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen. DWC systems suspend plant roots in a nutrient-rich solution, providing direct access to water and nutrients. Aeroponics systems intermittently spray a nutrient solution onto the roots suspended in the air, maximizing oxygen exposure. The research involved setting up these hydroponic systems in controlled environments in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. We tailored nutrient solutions to local water quality and climatic conditions, monitored plant growth, yield, water usage, and energy consumption over six months, and performed an economic analysis to assess the feasibility and sustainability of each system. International Journal of Agriculture and Nutrition 2022; 4(1): 105-109 ~ 106 ~ International Journal of Agriculture and Nutrition https://www.agriculturejournal.net Our goal was to identify the most efficient and viable hydroponic techniques for urban agriculture in India, providing insights and recommendations for future implementation and scaling. Objective To optimize hydroponic systems for high-density urban agriculture in India by evaluating the performance of NFT, DWC, and Aeroponics in terms of yield, water usage, and energy consumption across different urban environments. Materials and Methods Site Selection The study was conducted in three major urban centers in India: Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. These cities were selected based on their rapid urbanization, high population density, and significant demand for fresh produce.

These cities were chosen due to their distinct climatic conditions, diverse population, and varying levels of urban infrastructure, which provided a comprehensive understanding of the potential for hydroponic systems across different urban environments in India. Data Collection Three types of hydroponic systems were evaluated: Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Deep Water Culture (DWC), and Aeroponics. Each system was set up in a controlled environment with variations in nutrient solutions, lighting (using LED grow lights), and plant densities. Nutrient solutions were specifically formulated for the Indian context, taking into account local water quality and climatic conditions. The essential macro and micronutrients included nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and trace elements like iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), boron (B), and molybdenum (Mo). Regular monitoring and adjustments were made to maintain optimal pH levels (5.5 to 6.5) and electrical conductivity (EC) (1.2 to 2.4 mS/cm) in the nutrient solutions. Data on plant growth, yield, water usage, and energy consumption were collected over a period of six months. Plant growth and yield parameters such as plant height, leaf area, and biomass were measured weekly. Yield was quantified by harvesting and weighing the produce at maturity. Water usage was monitored by measuring the volume of water added to each system to maintain optimal levels. Energy consumption was recorded using power meters attached to lighting and pumping systems. Plant samples were collected at three different growth stages: early vegetative, mid-growth, and harvest. Random sampling was used to select plants from different sections of each hydroponic system to ensure representative data. Plant tissues were analyzed for nutrient content using standard laboratory techniques such as atomic absorption spectrophotometry for mineral analysis and the Kjeldahl method for nitrogen content. Growth rates were calculated by measuring increases in biomass and leaf area over time. Economic analysis Economic analysis included the initial setup costs, operational costs (Including nutrient solutions, energy, and maintenance), and return on investment (ROI). Detailed records of expenses for setting up each hydroponic system, including costs of materials, construction, and installation, were maintained. Monthly operational costs were tracked, focusing on nutrient solutions, energy consumption, water usage, and labor. ROI was calculated by comparing the total costs with the revenue generated from the sale of the produce over the study period. Statistical analysis The collected data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA to determine the significance of differences between hydroponic systems in terms of plant growth, yield, water usage, and energy consumption. Economic viability was assessed by comparing the ROI of each system. This detailed and methodical approach ensured that the study provided comprehensive insights into the optimization of hydroponic systems for high-density urban agriculture in India. ANOVA Table The ANOVA results indicate a statistically significant difference in the yields produced by the three hydroponic systems (p< 0.05). This suggests that the type of hydroponic system used has a significant impact on plant yield, highlighting the importance of optimizing system design and nutrient management for high-density urban agriculture in India.

The ANOVA analysis confirmed statistically significant differences among the three hydroponic systems evaluated: Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Deep Water Culture (DWC), and Aeroponics. These findings are crucial for optimizing hydroponic practices to meet the increasing demand for fresh produce in rapidly urbanizing areas. The Aeroponics system consistently outperformed both NFT and DWC systems across all three cities-Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. This system showed the highest average yield and the least variability, as illustrated in the box plot. Aeroponics provides superior oxygenation and nutrient delivery to plant roots, which likely contributes to enhanced plant growth and higher yields. The fine mist of nutrient solution in Aeroponics ensures that roots are well-aerated, which is critical for optimal nutrient absorption and growth. This system's efficiency in delivering nutrients directly to the root zone without waterlogging or nutrient deficiencies might explain its superior performance. The NFT system also demonstrated good performance, especially when compared to the DWC system. The constant flow of nutrient solution over the roots in NFT systems provides a steady supply of nutrients and oxygen, which supports healthy plant growth. However, it did not match the yields achieved by the Aeroponics system. The slight variability in NFT performance could be attributed to the potential for nutrient imbalances or blockages in the nutrient film, which can affect plant growth. The DWC system, while effective, showed the lowest average yields and the highest variability among the three systems. In DWC, plants are suspended in a nutrient-rich solution with roots submerged. This setup can sometimes lead to issues such as root oxygenation problems, particularly if the aeration system fails or is insufficient. The data suggest that while DWC is a viable option for hydroponics, it may require more precise management and monitoring to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth. The comparison across different cities-Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru-revealed consistent trends, with Aeroponics leading in yield across all locations. This consistency underscores the robustness of the Aeroponics system in various urban environments, despite differences in climate and other local conditions. The ability of Aeroponics to maintain high yields across diverse settings makes it a promising solution for urban agriculture in India. Water usage is a critical factor in urban farming, especially in water-scarce regions like many parts of India. Hydroponic systems significantly reduce water usage compared to traditional soil-based agriculture. The findings from this study reinforce the potential of hydroponics to address water scarcity issues while ensuring high agricultural productivity. Among the systems, Aeroponics uses the least water, followed by NFT and DWC. The efficient use of water in Aeroponics, coupled with its high yield, makes it an attractive option for sustainable urban agriculture. Energy consumption, however, is a concern for hydroponic systems. The need for continuous operation of pumps, lights, and aeration systems leads to higher energy demands. Integrating renewable energy sources, such as solar power, could mitigate this issue and enhance the sustainability of hydroponic systems. Future studies should explore the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using renewable energy to power hydroponic farms in urban settings. Economic analysis of the systems showed that despite the higher initial setup costs, hydroponic systems, particularly Aeroponics and NFT, offer favorable returns on investment due to their high yields and reduced water usage. Government incentives, subsidies, and training programs could further lower barriers to entry and encourage the adoption of hydroponic farming among urban farmers. In conclusion, the study highlights the significant impact of hydroponic system choice on plant yield in high-density urban agriculture. Aeroponics emerged as the most efficient system, offering the highest yields and consistent performance across different urban settings in India. The findings support the potential of hydroponic systems to enhance urban food security and sustainability. However, addressing energy consumption and initial cost barriers remains crucial for wider adoption.", "meta": {"title": "Optimizing Hydroponic Systems for High-Density Cultivation", "org": "IJAN", "year": "2022", "file": "Optimizing hydroponic systems for high-density IJAN.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Conclusion The optimization of hydroponic systems for high-density urban agriculture in India presents a viable and sustainable solution to meet the growing demand for fresh produce in rapidly urbanizing cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. This study evaluated three hydroponic systems- Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Deep Water Culture (DWC), and Aeroponics-across these urban environments, focusing on plant yield, water usage, and energy consumption. The results demonstrated that Aeroponics consistently produced the highest yields, followed by NFT and DWC. Aeroponics’ superior performance can be attributed to its efficient nutrient delivery and optimal oxygenation of roots, which promote faster growth and higher productivity. NFT also showed good performance but with slightly higher variability, while DWC exhibited the lowest yields and highest variability, indicating potential issues with root oxygenation and nutrient uptake. Water usage in hydroponic systems was significantly lower compared to traditional soil-based agriculture, highlighting the potential of hydroponics to address water scarcity issues in urban settings. Aeroponics, in particular, was the most water-efficient system. However, the higher energy consumption associated with hydroponic systems, especially for Aeroponics and NFT, remains a concern. Integrating renewable energy sources, such as solar power, could mitigate this issue and enhance the sustainability of hydroponic farming. The economic analysis revealed that despite higher initial setup costs, hydroponic systems, particularly Aeroponics and NFT, offer favourable returns on investment due to their high yields and reduced water usage.

Though, population is increasing at a faster pace; agricultural land capacity can increase by 2% only. As per an estimate, 342 million tonnes of vegetables will be required to cater the demand of consumers by the year 2050. Therefore, to improve the productivity and cropping intensity, protected cultivation of vegetables seems a promising proposition. Protected cultivation is taken up in special structures known as greenhouses. Depending on the covering material, different terminologies have been used in the context of greenhouse structures for instances, glasshouse, polyhouse, shade house, net house, etc. Technology Hare Krishna*, S N S Chaurasia, Anant Bahadur, S K Singh, Swati Sharma, Rajeev Kumar, Shubhdeep Roy and Manoj Kumar Singh T his technology has vast scope, particularly, in peri-urban areas near the major cities, which are rapidly growing markets for fresh vegetables. High value vegetable crops like, tomato, cherry tomato, coloured capsicum, parthenocarpic cucumber, brinjal, etc. and virus free seedlings in agri-entrepreneurial models can be grown profitably with the use of such technologies. The productivity obtained under protected cultivation is three to ten times higher than open methods of cultivation depending on the crops. These technologies offer numerous advantages such as save water, increase crop production, are environment-friendly, give round the year food production, and provide jobs for residents. However, protected cultivation requires thorough planning, utmost consideration and details about timing of production (keeping in view the demand and prevailing market prices), choice of varieties adapted to the off-season environments, consumer preferences, etc. in order to be able to produce high yields of quality produce. It was estimated that about 2.15 lakh hectare of land was brought under the National Horticulture Mission between 2005–06 and 2017–18. The major states adopting the protected cultivation technologies are Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Basically the growth of protected cultivation technology in the country happened mainly due to government policies providing handsome subsidies under various schemes launched by government of India under MIDH (NHM), TM, NHB, RKVY, etc., but merely due to the technical beauty of the technology. Suitable crops and crop cycle High value-low volume crops are usually raised in polyhouses. Tomato, cherry tomato, capsicum, parthenocarpic cucumber, gherkins, zucchini, watermelon and muskmelon are the most widely grown vegetable crops under protected cultivation to augment higher return. Initially, most of the varieties suitable for protected cultivation were from private sector; however, at present, many varieties developed by public sector research organizations, such as Tomato: Pusa Tomato (Protected-1), Pusa Rakshit, Arka Meghali, Arka Saurav, Pant Poly House Tomato-1, Pant Poly House Tomato Hybrid-1; Cherry tomato: Punjab Red Cherry, Punjab Sona Cherry, Punjab Kesar Cherry, Pusa Cherry Tomato-1; Cucumber: Pant Parthenocarpic Cucumber-2 and 3, Him Palam Khira-1; Capsicum: Arka Gaurav, Arka Basant, etc. have shown promise for cultivation under protected environment. Recently, Pusa Seedless Cucumber-6 first extra-early variety has been developed which is a parthenocarpic, gynoecious cucumber and is suitable for protected conditions.

Crop cycle under protected cultivation depends upon market demand and to a fairly good extent upon climatic conditions if crops are being taken under naturally ventilated polyhouses or partially controlled environment. As a result, timing of transplanting can be flexible. For instance, tomato can be transplanted from mid-September to first week of November and accordingly can be harvested till March to May under north Indian conditions. In north-western parts, tomato transplanted in mid-July can continue up to the end of April or mid-May next year depending upon the crop management and climatic conditions. However, the window of flexibility depends upon crops as well. Unlike tomato, Capsicum has relatively smaller window of transplanting period. It is preferable to transplant it from September to October; however, mid-September is the most ideal period of transplant in north India, while in north-west states, it can be transplanted in the first week of August and can continue up to end of April in the next year in the polyhouse. Likewise, capsicum can be grown from October to April without using shade net on the top of the roof of the insect proof net house with 40% shade net intensity; while", "meta": {"title": "Protected Cultivation of Vegetable Crops for Sustainable Food Production", "org": "ICAR IndHort", "year": "2023", "file": "Protected cultivation of vegetable crops for sustainable food production Indian Council of Agricultural Research IndHort Vol.68, No.2 (2023).pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The parthenocarpic cucumber can be grown in insect proof net house from September to mid-December and mid-February to April. Further, off-seasonality should be the main criteria to fetch higher profits. Therefore, planting time should be chosen in such a way that a compromise can be struck between climatic requirement of a crop and market demand. Dimension and structural design of the greenhouse The dimension of NV (naturally ventilated) GH should not be more than 50 m × 50 m. Bigger the greenhouse more will be the temperature build up due to poor ventilation. The length of evaporative cooled greenhouse should not be more than 60 m. The height of the greenhouse depends upon its size. However, the ideal height of NV small GH (up to 250 sqm) should be between 3.5 to 4.5 m at gutter. While for large polyhouses, it should be in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 m at gutter. The ideal height at the centre should be between 6.0-6.5 m. The side ventilation can be of 2 m width and roof ventilation 1 m in width. The spacing between two naturally ventilated greenhouses should be 10 to 15 m so that the exhaust from one greenhouse should not enter the adjacent Parthenocarpic gynoecious cucumber suited for protected cultivation Naturally ventilated polyhouse suitable for hot and humid weather conditions Points to remember y y Aerodynamic shape and design along the periphery to withstand stalk and wind effects. y y Fan to pad distance should be limited to 40 m otherwise cooling uniformity will not be attained in fan and pad system. greenhouse. The green structure should be able to take all the loads like dead material, live and wind loads. So, greenhouse should be designed in such a way that it will keep safety, serviceability, general structural integrity and suitability. The foundation, columns and trusses are to be designed accordingly. Design loads prescribed by National Horticulture Board, Gurugram (Technical Standards for Naturally V entilated, Fan & Pad Green House and Shade Net House; Technical Standard No. NHB-PH-Type 02- 2011) may be followed while designing and constructing a greenhouse. March–April 2023 41 On the basis of environmental control system, polyhouses can be categorized into two types: Naturally ventilated polyhouse/greenhouse: These polyhouses/greenhouses do not have any environmental control system except for adequate ventilation and fogger system facility mainly to prevent the crops from adverse weather conditions and other natural pests and diseases. Under such polyhouses, temperature regulation is done through passive means, i.e. without the involvement of energy (electricity). The total minimum ventilated area should be at least 10% of the ground area. The temperature inside greenhouse is moderated by rolling up or rolling down the polythene sheets over side ventilators/ screens. However during summers when temperature inside polyhouse goes beyond 35°C, use of shade net (50%) or reflective aluminet thermal screens is suggested to lower the ambient temperature. Now-a-days, use of aluminet is preferred over traditional shade net due to better cooling. These nets/screens can be spread permanently as a ceiling beneath greenhouse roofs, or to be installed as a moveable thermal screen. Insect proof net of 40-50% perforation is essential for covering the ventilated area.

Plant growth stage based fertilization schedule has also been worked out for crops like tomato. Environmental controlled polyhouse/greenhouse: These polyhouses are constructed mainly to extend the growing period of crops or to increase the off-season production of crops by controlling the light, temperature, humidity, carbon-dioxide level and the nature of rooting medium in the polyhouses through external means. Walk-in tunnels: Walk-in tunnels structure is of 2 or 3 m height and is covered with UV film, which is suitable for all types of vegetable crops like okra, brinjal, tomato, chilli, summer squash, gourds, melons, French bean, etc. This structure is meant for cultivation of vegetables during peak winter months so as to protect the crop against low temperature. Such structures are suitable for off-season cultivation of vegetable crops. For instances, summer squash can be raised from December to February, while bottle gourd, sponge gourd and ridge gourd may be taken up from November to March and muskmelon and watermelon during January to April and October to January. Plastic low tunnels: These are miniature structures (0.75-1.0 m height) producing greenhouse like effect, which facilitates the entrapment of carbon dioxide; thereby, enhancing the photosynthetic activity. For construction of low tunnels, film of 100 µ is sufficient. It protects plants from harsh climatic conditions such as rain, wind, hail, snow, etc. When the climatic conditions are favourable the cladding material may be removed. These are mainly used for raising nursery or for early cucurbit production, e.g. muskmelon and watermelon. Off-season cultivation of cucurbits under low plastic tunnels is one of the most promising technologies under the northern plains of India. Net houses: Depending upon the cladding (covering) material used, the net houses may be categorized as either insect-proof net houses or shade net houses. Shade net houses are used for raising vegetables during peak summer months (April to June) to protect the crops against high temperature and radiation. These structures have flat top design and are of 3 m height. It is covered with shading net of suitable shading capacity (35-90% shade) and colour depending on the crop requirement. Leafy vegetables (such as coriander, spinach and mint) can successfully be raised during April to July with 40-60% shading intensity. Likewise, chilli/capsicum can be grown from February to June with 30-40% shading intensity. An insect-proof net house is covered with UV-stabilised insect-proof net of 40–50 mesh for effective restriction on entry of insect- pests in polyhouses. Both nursery raising and quality are Bountiful production of tomato under protected cultivation Nursery raising and cucurbits production in plastic low tunnels Indian Horticulture 42 possible under these net houses with proper selection of varieties without application of synthetic pesticides in their production. Rain shelters: Tomato production is difficult during the hot-wet season in tropical and subtropical climates. Rain shelters protect tomato plants against the impact of heavy rainfall and can reduce disease spread. The shelters are generally used in conjunction with raised plant beds to minimize flooding damage and water logging.

The solid materials of soilless growing media (hydroponics and aeroponics) alone or in mixtures may provide superior environment for plants in comparison to agricultural soil. However, there isn’t enough material on how to grow Indian vegetables using this method, which is why most farmers end up growing ‘exotic vegetables’ with imported seeds. Many of the components required to build these growth systems have to be imported too, increasing the carbon footprint of what is a low-carbon cultivation method. India is currently importing more than 85% of its exotic vegetables, creating a growth rate of 15-20% per year. Hydroponic cultivation in India is still in infancy stage. Very few research institutions are working on this area of future farming. Researchers at the Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Nadia had initial success in working on vertical farming hydroponically on a small scale. Likewise in C.P.R.I., Shimla, Himachal Pradesh and P.A.U., Ludhiana, scientists have attained success in growing potato tubers in soilless conditions. At C.P.C.T., IARI, New Delhi and C.I.S.H., Lucknow, scientists are working on hydroponic cultivation of crops like cucumber, tomato and capsicum. In India, hydroponics meets less than 1% of the total food basket. However, the fruits and vegetables hydroponic market is estimated to reach a market value of USD 11,195.74 thousand by 2027 from an initial market value of USD 2544.15 thousand in 2018. The market is estimated to grow at CAGR of 13.53% in the forecasted period 2020-2027. These predictions are favoured by the fact that the sales opportunities abound from Indian producers due to better production costing achievable, markets for such produce in USA, EU, Far and Middle East and India’s excellent connectivity to these destinations by land, sea and air. In addition, under post-coronavirus pandemic, the adoption rate of urban hydroponic farming systems around the world are estimated to rise sharply as many individuals have developed a critical point of view towards outdoor food. Economic feasibility of soilless cultivation The initial investment into the farm can be quite high; the cost of setting up one acre of land can start from `30-35 lakh. When the land is already owned, capital costs per acre every 5 years are `30.5 lakhs. Operational costs, with tomatoes as the example crop, in 1 acre per year are `9 lakhs and revenue typically averages around `33.5 lakhs. If the land is independently owned the profit potential of `15 lakhs per year is slightly less than if it were leased, averaging around `16.5 lakhs per year. However, it would be important to note that in the first year, when a greenhouse is purchased, 80% depreciation is available under the Indian Income Tax Act to the buyer; 75% bank finance is available through agriculture loans and a 20% subsidy on greenhouses is available from National Horticulture Board (NHB). Besides, insurance is also available for portable greenhouses in India. Competitive landscape vis-à-vis soilless cultivation The prominent players in Indian hydroponics market are from private sectors. The key strategies adopted by them is establishment of new commercial plants in tier 1 cities in collaboration between regional producers and global technology providers to meet the growing demand for exotic and organic foods. Further, over the next few years, the market might experience huge competition through major food chains across the globe, establishing their hydroponics farms in India.

Vegetable grafting for protected cultivation Grafting is the union of two or more pieces of living plant tissue, which grow as a single unified plant. Grafting vegetable scion plant onto desirable rootstocks is an effective tool to mitigate targeted soil-borne diseases, edaphic stresses (moisture imbalances, salt stress) and enhancing yield and quality of vegetable. In India, researches on vegetable grafting to combat abiotic stresses, particularly moisture imbalance, are underway at ICAR- IIHR, Bengaluru; ICAR-CAZRI, Jodhpur and ICAR- IIVR, Varanasi in Solanaceous and Cucurbitaceous crops. NBPGR regional station, Thrissur, Kerala have done work on Momordica cochinchinensis. The female plants were grafted onto the male plants to increase its production. CSKHPKV, Palampur initiated work on grafting and identified more than 22 rootstocks of brinjal, chilli, tomato and cucurbits for importing resistance to bacterial wilt and nematodes. Amongst private sector, VNR Seed Private Limited and Takii Seed India Private Limited are producing grafted vegetable seedlings resistant to bacterial wilt for farmers. Feats of protected cultivation: IIVR’s intervention in empowering rural youths Quality planting material is the basic requirement for production of high value vegetables. Raising of vegetables seedlings through traditional soil beds is not usually recommended owing to quick soil borne disease dispersal and the vulnerability of roots to damage at the time of uprooting for transplantation. On the other hand, plug tray nursery raising technique is not only efficient in vigorous root development but also suitable to avoid any damage to the roots and shoots of the seedlings at the time of transplanting. Plug tray nursery raising holds tremendous potential in providing job opportunities among rural youths. Training and support imparted by ICAR-IIVR to the tribal girls students of Sonebhadra district has created a success story, never seen before, in the adopted village. Likewise, due to the support provided by the Institutes, a farmer Sh. Awaneesh Patel from Raja Talab, Varanasi earned a net profit of `1.31 lakhs from the sale of Capsicum grown under a hitherto deserted 1000 m2 polyhouse (due to lack of technical know-how). Improved production practices for protected cultivation are uplifting the socio-economic status of the farmers. However, such technologies need to be popularized on large scales, more particularly, among the rural youths.

Despite a significant increase in area under protected cultivation in recent years, the country lags well behind the neighbouring China in its adoption. In addition, there is apprehension that it will be adopted by the large, educated and progressive farmers as protected cultivation technology is capital intensive. To address this issue, massive subsidies, especially on low cost protected structures, may be provided to the economically weaker sections of the farming communities. Regular campaigning to popularise the benefits of such technologies may be undertaken in order to convince farmers to adopt such technologies for realising higher incomes.

The technique involves wounding/incision on branches with diameter of 5 mm at 30 cm above ground level using sharp knife/blade to remove the bark followed by application of 2,500 ppm IBA as rooting hormone. The treatment starts from the second week of June till the last week of August. Small polybags (filled with rooting medium) are fastened at the points where rooting needs to be initiated. A lightweight substrate (cocopeat) having high moisture holding capacity is used as rooting medium. Staking is accomplished with the help of bamboo poles to hold the bags in a proper position and to keep the plants straight. This technology is very useful in promoting the vertical expansion of the nursery in greenhouse conditions and the multiplication of number of plants per unit area has increased by three to four times with minimum utilization of extra inputs and area. One more additional benefit of this technology is that under the greenhouse conditions, the rootstocks attain sufficient girth (> 6 mm) and all the plants are suitable for budding. The technology not only produced the additional 3-4 rootstocks but also the budded plants which have added advantage to this technology.

We also discuss the current challenges facing hydroponic farming, such as disease and pest management, energy use, and cost, and highlight areas for future research. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of hydroponic farming and its potential impact on agriculture and food production. Keyword: Hydroponics, Urban agriculture, Plant growth, Sustainable agriculture, Controlled environment, Nutrient management. Introduction: Hydroponic farming is an innovative agricultural method that involves growing of plants in a soil-free environment, using water which is nutrient-rich instead of soil. This method is based on the premise that the water-based environment can provide all the necessary nutrients for plant growth, and that the plants can extract these nutrients from the water. Hydroponics has been in existence for over 75 years and has been used for various applications, including research, commercial production, and education. This system has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its numerous benefits, including increased water and nutrient efficiency, reduced land use, and increased crop yield and quality. Despite these advantages, hydroponic farming is still considered an emerging field, and further research is needed to fully understand its potential and limitations. Types of Hydroponic Systems Although there are many other hydroponic farming techniques, there are six fundamental varieties that can be divided into active and passive systems:- 1. Wick System The Wick System, which is frequently thought of as the most straightforward kind of hydroponics, is referred to as a passive system, which simply means that it has no moving parts. Instead, wicks are utilized to draw nutrient solution into the growing media. These wicks hang down into a water reservoir. Perlite, Vermiculite, Rockwool, and Coconut Fiber are among the most widely used growing mediums that can be utilized with this technique. Although it is the most straightforward approach, it is not recommended for growing large plants or plants that require a lot of water since these plants may use the nutrient solution more quickly than the wicks can replenish it. 2. Water Culture This system is active since it contains moving pieces. Water Cultures are still regarded as the most basic type of active system, nevertheless. With this technique, the plant roots are fully submerged in the water reservoir containing the nutritional solution. The water is usually oxygenated with the aid of a pump, allowing the roots to breathe. Although this technique is sometimes regarded as the most straightforward active system, few plants are suitable for it. Similar to the Wick System, big plants are not a good fit for this technique. 3. Ebb & Flow System With these methods, the water-based fertilizer solution temporarily floods the grow tray. The solution is then used to encircle the plant roots before being drained back into the reservoir using a pump that is submerged in the liquid. Usually, a timer is used to automate this operation. These adaptable systems work with a range of growing media. 4. Drip System The most common kind of hydroponic system in use today. A network of raised misting jets that spray the plants from above are controlled by a submerged pump that pumps water and fertilizer solution from a reservoir. This system comes in two main forms: one with a recovery International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 4, no 4, pp 825-832 April 2023 826 system that collects nutritional solution and returns it to the reservoir, and the other without. Non-recovery systems require less upkeep since they keep the reservoir's pH level from fluctuating, even though recovery systems can use the nutrient solution more efficiently. 5. N.F.T. System Most people probably envision a system like this when they think of hydroponics. The nutrient Film Technique, also known as NFT, is a technique that uses a continuous flow of nutrient solution that is pumped from the reservoir into the growing tray. This system has the significant benefit of not requiring a growing medium because the plants are supported by tiny plastic baskets, allowing the roots to hang down and absorb nutrients directly from the solution. In order to avoid technical problems, this type of system can be rather high maintenance; however, once the flow of nutrients stops, plant roots can quickly dry out. 6. Aeroponic System This hydroponic technique is frequently thought of as high-tech. Similar to the NFT system, there is no growing medium; instead,", "meta": {"title": "Research on Hydroponics Farming", "org": "IJRPR", "year": "2022", "file": "Research on Hydroponics Farming IJRPR.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

This method, like the NFT system, necessitates considerable attention because if the misting cycle is broken, the roots quickly dry out. SWOT Analysis of Hydroponics Company 1. Strengths: a. Water conservation: Hydroponics systems use up to 90% less water than traditional soil-based agriculture, which can be a significant advantage in water-scarce regions. b. Space efficiency: Hydroponic systems can be set up vertically or horizontally, allowing for efficient use of space in areas where land is limited. c. Higher crop yield: With hydroponics, plants can grow faster and produce higher yields because they have access to consistent nutrient and water supply and are not limited by soil quality. d. Reduced pesticide use: Because hydroponic plants are grown in a controlled environment, there is less risk of pest infestation, reducing the need for harmful pesticides. e. Year-round production: Hydroponic systems can be used indoors, which allows for year-round production regardless of climate. 2. Weaknesses: a. High setup costs: Setting up a hydroponic system can be expensive, particularly for larger commercial operations. b. Dependence on technology: The reliance on technology is evident in hydroponics as it necessitates specific tools and a certain level of technical proficiency to sustain, which may impede some cultivators. c. Susceptibility to power outages: In the absence of power, hydroponic plants may not receive the necessary nutrients and water, which could lead to crop failure. d. Disposal of nutrient solutions: The nutrient solutions used in hydroponics can be harmful to the environment if not disposed of properly. 3. Opportunities: a. Growing demand for locally sourced produce: Hydroponics provides an opportunity for growers to produce fresh, locally sourced produce, which is becoming increasingly popular with consumers. b. Increased urbanization: As urban areas continue to grow, hydroponics can provide a means of producing food in a limited space. c. Sustainable food production: Hydroponics can be an environmentally sustainable means of producing food, particularly when combined with renewable energy sources. d. Experimentation with new crops: Hydroponics allows for experimentation with growing crops that are not traditionally suited to certain climates or soil types. 4. Threats: a. Competition from traditional agriculture: Despite the benefits of hydroponics, traditional agriculture methods remain dominant and may be seen as a more affordable option. b. Lack of consumer awareness: Some consumers may not be familiar with hydroponically grown produce and may be hesitant to purchase it. International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 4, no 4, pp 825-832 April 2023 827 c. Regulatory issues: Some countries may not have regulations in place for hydroponic production, which can make it difficult for growers to operate. d. Energy costs: Hydroponic systems require significant energy use, particularly for heating and lighting, which can be expensive and potentially unsustainable if not powered by renewable energy sources. Market size and trends In 2020, the hydroponics industry had a value of USD 2.1 billion and is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 20.7% from 2021 to 2028. The rapid growth of the industry can be attributed to the increasing acceptance of hydroponic systems for indoor vegetable cultivation. Moreover, countries such as Canada, the Czech Republic, and South Africa have legalized marijuana, resulting in unconventional agricultural methods being used for marijuana production. As consumers become more aware of the harmful effects of pesticides and artificial ripening agents, the use of hydroponics is expected to increase since it eliminates the need for these substances and produces healthier vegetables. Fig. U.S Hydroponic Market (2018-2028) In 2020, aggregate systems dominated the hydroponics market, accounting for about 55% of the market share. These systems are popular among indoor hydroponic growers due to their easy installation and affordability. They use inert and solid media, such as sand, rock wool, vermiculite, and peat, to support the plants. Different technologies, such as drip, ebb, flow, and wick systems, are used in aggregate systems.

International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 4, no 4, pp 825-832 April 2023 828 Fig Aggregate and Liquid Global Hydroponic System The liquid systems segment is expected to experience the highest CAGR growth from 2021 to 2028 due to growers' preference for closed-system cultivation. This segment comprises deep water culture and nutrient film technique (NFT) systems, which are increasingly used for growing leafy vegetables like lettuce. Liquid systems eliminate the need for a solid medium and enable roots to be directly placed in the nutrient solution, which promotes growth and increases yields. While soilless farming techniques reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases, recirculating nutrient solutions in closed systems may increase the risk of pathogen spread. As a result, liquid systems require frequent maintenance to monitor and replace nutrient solutions to avoid these risks. Objectives: The study's objectives are to Review the current state of hydroponic farming research and applications. Identify the benefits and limitations of hydroponic farming. Discuss the challenges facing hydroponic farming, including disease and pest management, energy use, and cost. Highlight areas for future research in hydroponic farming. Review of Literature: 1. Hydroponic systems are widely used in the commercial production of various crops, such as lettuce and tomatoes, and have been a favoured method for conducting plant biology research. Numerous hydroponic systems have been created by the plant research community to investigate how plants respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. This process offers detailed guidance on establishing a hydroponic system and preparing plant material. 2. The consumption of nutrient solutions is vital for the growth of crops, particularly tomatoes. A study was conducted to assess the impact of two hydroponic systems on the yield components, nutrient solution effectiveness, and stomatal gas exchanges of two greenhouse tomato cultivars. The traits examined in this study included crop yield, fruit number, fruit weight, cluster weight, nutrient solution efficiency, and stomatal gas exchanges such as net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, and leaf temperature. 3. As the global population continues to grow, the demand for many products, especially food, increases. This rising demand is expected to cause a food crisis in the coming years. To avert such crises, alternative farming practices and food sources must be utilized. This essay aims to compare and contrast two farming practices to identify which one can best fulfil current and future demand while minimizing resource use and cost. 4. All of our daily activities are now affected by automation, and since we humans have grown accustomed to it, we now anticipate it in all aspects of our lives. However, several industries still need to advance at different levels, and one of these industries is agriculture. This system International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 4, no 4, pp 825-832 April 2023 829 finds a gateway to the cultivation of plants in areas like deserts, barren lands and buildings as all the nutrients like oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. are supplied manually to the plants. 5. Soil-based agriculture is facing challenges due to human activities such as industrialization and urbanization, as well as natural disasters and climate change, and the unregulated use of chemicals in farming which all decrease soil fertility and quality. To address these issues, researchers have developed an alternative method known as hydroponics, which involves cultivating plants in a water-based, nutrient-rich solution. 6. The purpose of this study of the literature is to provide readers with a knowledge base on which future research in the area of global sustainable food production may be built.

This study's goal is to evaluate a hydroponic farm (using the nutrient film technology) while taking risk, sustainability, and the system's utility in the primarily desert environment into consideration. The hydroponic farm's objective is to enable individuals and organizations to grow their plants. Given the geographical circumstances, the hydroponic system might be advantageous in the Gulf environment and lead to food sustainability and security. Several support programmes that can be used to invest in businesses that can increase the nation's food security have also been launched by the UAE government. 8. The objective of this study is to investigate the utilization of two categories of agricultural technologies by new farmers (i.e., those with 10 years or less of experience) operating in the speciality crops sector. This study investigates the idea that inexperienced farmers are less likely to use agricultural technology, such as growth methods (like hydroponics and hoop houses) and value-added (VA) methods (such as drying and cutting products into sections suitable for sale). Using a distinct primary dataset of speciality crop farmers, the dependent variable for each model is the binary decision to adopt each agricultural technology. The primary variables of interest are the dummy variables \"beginning farmers\" and \"land farmed,\" \"per cent of land farmed,\" and the interaction terms between these variables. 9. The primary goal of this essay is to analyze the correlation between smart farming and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, which aims to eradicate hunger. The article also employs a SWOT analysis to identify the benefits, drawbacks, opportunities, and risks of implementing smart farming in Southeast Asia (SEA). This study makes use of a SWOT analysis to look at the advantages of smart farming in Southeast Asia in order to end world hunger. To conduct the SWOT analysis, a thorough review of prior and relevant literature on smart farming and its relationship to SDG 2 is conducted. The use of SWOT analysis provides a foundation for figuring out the desired future position, and identifies current 10. The difficulties in achieving food security are framed by six ideas in this essay. It has been suggested that having a better understanding of the factors may aid decision-makers in communities, organisations, and businesses, improving food security. Relevant strategies or policies can then emerge and be established so that strategic and operational interventions can be prioritised at the national, regional, or industrial level. Underpinning everything mentioned above, waste from within and throughout the food supply chain contributes to the six criteria, highlighting areas that may need more attention if food supply networks are to be sustained. 11. The development of sustainable agriculture may be aided by the use of organic wastes in high-value applications. Keratin and cellulose are two typical natural biopolymers found in biowastes like hair, bird feathers, wood shavings, and vegetable trimmings. These waste-derived biopolymers are used in this study to break down keratin and create bioactive nutrient substrates that can support crop development in hydroponic culture systems. This study demonstrates the viability and potential of recycling keratinous and cellulosic wastes to provide crops with specific nutrients in a sustainable way. 12. Agriculture has long been the most widely used means of obtaining food supplies. It is also closely related to the elimination of poverty, rural development, and food security. Although hydroponics techniques are now among the most widely used plant-growing techniques globally, the soil has historically been thought to be the most important requirement for growing food crops. Plants can be grown without soil and still benefit the environment with the right fertiliser solution. Numerous studies have used hydroponics to look at how plants respond to biotic and abiotic stimuli. The food security crisis facing the world has a promising solution in this agriculture system, which will also advance technology towards the goal of becoming a self-sustaining model for future generations. 13.

United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization states that there will be nine billion people on the planet by 2050, with 75% of them living in cities. One of the biggest issues will be feeding everyone, as farmland is being lost due to issues like soil contamination, a lack of water, and climate change, among other things. In this case, hydroponics, an agricultural method that doesn't use soil, offers a workable solution to this problem. Additionally, in remote locations with restricted access to acceptable technologies. 14. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is produced when supplied minerals are exposed to oxidising conditions as a result of mining and other excavation processes. Because AMD can continue to be produced for hundreds of years even after mining activities have ended, when AMD is discharged to the ground, it will severely pollute the soil and nearby water bodies, lower the pH of surface water, impede the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms, and destroy the granular structure of the soil. In addition to having a high concentration of heavy metals, sulphates, and other pollutants, AMD is also very acidic. It is urgently necessary to look into reasonably priced and efficient treatment options due to AMD's significant pollution problem in order to lessen its negative effects.

Hydroponic systems can provide precise control over nutrient delivery and environmental conditions, leading to increased crop yields and higher-quality produce. In terms of nutrient management, the literature showed that hydroponic farming allows for precise control over the nutrient solution, resulting in optimal plant growth and productivity. However, nutrient imbalances can still occur, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies or toxicities if not monitored and corrected promptly. Environmental control is another crucial aspect of hydroponic farming, as it allows for precise control over temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 levels. However, the cost of energy and equipment required to maintain optimal environmental conditions can be a significant challenge for hydroponic farmers. The literature also highlighted several challenges facing hydroponic farming, including disease and pest management, high energy use and associated costs, and the need for specialized knowledge and expertise. In addition, the high capital costs associated with setting up a hydroponic system can be a barrier to entry for small-scale farmers. Overall, the analysis of the literature suggests that hydroponic farming has significant potential to revolutionize agriculture and food production, but further research is needed to fully understand its potential and limitations and to address the challenges facing hydroponic farming. Areas for future research include the development of more efficient and cost-effective hydroponic systems, optimization of nutrient management and environmental control, and exploration of new plant species for hydroponic cultivation. Conclusion: Hydroponic farming is a soilless cultivation method that has the potential to revolutionize agriculture and food production. The systematic literature review conducted in this study revealed that hydroponic systems offer precise control over nutrient management and environmental conditions, resulting in increased crop yields and higher-quality produce. However, hydroponic farming also has its challenges, including high capital costs, energy consumption, and the need for specialized knowledge and expertise. Disease and pest management is another important issue that must be addressed in hydroponic farming, as it can lead to significant crop losses. International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 4, no 4, pp 825-832 April 2023 831 Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of hydroponic farming are significant, including increased crop yields, reduced water consumption, and improved food security. The technology has already been applied in a variety of settings, from small-scale urban farms to large-scale commercial operations. In order to maximize the benefits of hydroponic farming, more research is required to improve nutrient and environmental management, enhance the efficiency and affordability of hydroponic systems, and identify new crops that can be grown using hydroponic techniques. Additionally, solutions must be developed to overcome challenges related to pest and disease management, energy consumption, and the significant initial costs of establishing a hydroponic system. In conclusion, It summarizes the potential of hydroponic farming as a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional agriculture, and emphasizes the importance of further research and development in order to fully realize its potential. Overall, hydroponic farming has the potential to address the challenges of a growing global population while also reducing environmental impact. Reference 1. Treftz, C. and Omaye, S.T.

During 2017-18 the production of Fruits is 97 Million MT and that of Vegetables is 184 million MT and that of flowers is 2.4 Million MT. The salient features of commercial Horticulture are Perishability, intense Technology, High Profitability accompanied with high investment and High Risks including vulnerability to post-harvest losses. Overall it demands very good entrepreneurship and leadership. Indian floriculture market was worth Rs 130 billion in year 2017 it has been projected to reach 394 billion by 2023 at CAGR of 20% during 2018-2023. GOI has identified as sunrise industry and accorded it 100% export oriented status. Owing to steady increase in demand commercial floriculture has emerged as Hi-Tech activity taking place under controlled climatic conditions inside greenhouse. National Horticulture Board, an autonomous organisation under the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India has been promoting and developing commercial horticulture in the country since 1984.Appreciating both the challenges and prospects of commercial horticulture, so as to mitigate constraints and risks and maximise benefits and net income, NHB has taken a number of initiatives viz., Model Detail Project Reports, conducting both awareness and technical workshops and simplification of scheme implementation process. One another measure taken up is encouraging farmers, entrepreneurs and applicants desirous of availing benefit under its schemes to have requisite entrepreneurship and leadership by undergoing a 06 days training programme at one of the best training institutes recognised by it. Rationale for the Training: NHB projects are credit linked and back ended and are capital intensive running from several lakhs to several crores. In addition these involve good documentation and timebound activities on the part of promoter, banker and other stakeholders. So endeavour should be to ensure that the project is successful by all means be addressing all possible risks. Over the years it has been observed by NHB that most of the promoters of NHB projects are not having the required understanding of scheme documentation, timebound activities and lack knowledge and skills of handling the project themselves and thus become subjected to vagaries of others ignorance and omissions and commissions. The result is a number of projects have failed or became ineligible for subsidy consideration. Thus so as to rule out any these omissions and commissions and risks, NHB has made it mandatory for every applicant to undergo a 06 days training programme at one of the NHB recognised /approved institution, with a goal of zero rejection of a project for which IPA is issued. 4 Importance of Project: Crop / Activity: Global/National/State and role in horticulture development Name of Activity Protected cultivation of Vegetables- Tomato, Capsicum and Cucumber Profile of the Institute: Centre for Protected Cultivation Technology, ICAR-IARI PUSA NEW DELHI 12 The Centre was established in the year 1998-99 as demonstration farm and commissioned as Indo-Israel project in January 2000 as a project undertaken jointly by the government of India, through Department of Agricultural Research & Education (DARE) & ICAR and the Government of the State of Israel, through the Centre of International Cooperation (MASHAV) & CINADCO.

GAP primarily involve the application of good management practices to maintain the consumer confidence in food quality and food safety by taking into account the optimal use of inputs to ensure worker health and minimizing detrimental environmental impacts on farming operations. To set standards for the certification of agricultural products around the globe, Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group (EUREPGAP) was initiated during 1997 and which later evolved into GLOBALGAP. GLOBALGAP is a private sector body that aims to establish ONE standard for GAP with different product applications capable of fitting to the whole of global agriculture. It is a pre-farm-gate standard, which means that the certificate covers the process of the certified product from farm inputs like feed or seedlings and all the farming activities until the product leaves the farm. GLOBALGAP is a business-to-business label and is therefore not directly visible to consumers. Its certification is carried out by more than 100 independent and accredited certification bodies in more than 100 countries. It is open to all producers worldwide. It includes annual inspections of the producers and additional unannounced inspections. It consists of a set of normative documents. These documents cover the GLOBALGAP General Regulations, the GLOBALGAP Control Points and Compliance Criteria and the GLOBALGAP Checklist. It has now been established as a key reference for GAP in the global market place, by translating consumer requirements into agricultural production in a rapidly growing list of countries – currently more than 100 from every continent. Food safety becomes a joint responsibility of all organizations within the food chain including producers, manufacturers, transport & storage operators, sub contractors, retail and food service outlets and service providers. The Bureau of Technical Bulletin No. 23 2 Indian Standards (BIS) has launched Food Safety Management Systems (FSMS) Certification IS/ISO 22000:2005 scheme which envisages grant of FSMS Certification licence to organizations according to IS/ISO 22000. A multiplicity of GAP codes, standards and regulations have been developed in recent years, not only by the food industry and producers’ organizations, but also by governments and NGOs, aiming to codify agricultural practices at farm level for a range of commodities. Their purpose varies from fulfilment of trade and government regulatory requirements (in particular with regard to food safety and quality), to more specific requirements of speciality or niche markets. The objective of these GAP codes, standards and regulations include, to a varying degree: • Ensuring safety and quality of produce in the food chain, • Capturing new market advantages by modifying supply chain governance, • Improving natural resources use, workers’ health and working conditions, and/or • Creating new market opportunities for farmers and exporters in developing countries. Four Pillars of GAP: • Economic Viability • Environmental Sustainability • Social Acceptability • Food Quality and safety In India, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has taken initiatives to develop its own standards to be followed by institutions and companies, etc. The draft Indian Standard Good Agricultural Practices – IndiaGAP (Part 1- Crop Base) takes into account not only the quality and quantity of the crop obtained from a unit area but also the care and attention gone into integrating pre-harvest practices like soil & water management, nutrient management and pest management, harvesting, post harvest handling and other logistics (Anon., 2008). The objective is to ensure food safety, occupational health/safety/welfare, and wherever possible, animal welfare.

Complaint form Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for IPM in Protected Cultivation 3 Bureau of Indian Standards. Food and Agriculture Department of Bureau of Indian Standards has formulated various standards since inception and has so far developed around 1800 standards in the following areas including – pesticides, sugar, apiary, tobacco, livestock feeds, equipment, stimulant foods, soil quality and fertilizers, food additives, spices and condiments, processed fruit and vegetable, agricultural tractors, fish and fisheries products, oil and oilseeds, drinks and carbonated beverages, food hygiene, safety management food grains, starches and ready to eat foods, irrigation systems, farm implements, slaughter house and meat, dairy products and equipments, agriculture and food processing equipments, agriculture management and systems, biotechnology and specialized products. These standards are for products, methods of test, code of practice, terminology, symbols and systems. However, the BIS - IndiaGAP draft document still needs to be finalized before if could he used as standard. GAP and Protected Cultivation Protected cultivation including greenhouse production systems require adherence to GAP protocols because intensive cultivation in greenhouses often involves excessive use of chemicals since the stakes are high due to intensive inputs and high expectations on quality front. Therefore, perennial production coupled with indiscriminate chemcalization leads to severe pest infestation and consequent high levels of pesticide residues. Older greenhouses often face more severe pest situations and hence maintaining economic profitability of farms is difficult without high chemical inputs as pest multiplication is much faster – compelling growers to resort to excessive chemical use. Therefore, greenhouse production systems require even stricter adherence to GAP protocols. GAP for Protected Cultivation Farms – Summary Recommendations Water management • Ensure clean uncontaminated water from safe source - Water storage tank should be kept clean and covered - Minimize access to stored water by erecting fences - Disposal of waste such that water doesn’t get contaminated • Use of water for all foliar applications should be from a pathogen free source Table 1 : Proposed Graded Pattern for verification under BIS IndiaGAP Category of Major Major Licence compliances compliances lndiaGAP - A 100% 90% IndiaGAP - B 100% 80% lndiaGAP - C 100% 75% Technical Bulletin No. 23 4 Primary Filtration Automatic Fertigation Control Clean and filtered water supply Proper Water Drainage from Polyhouses Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for IPM in Protected Cultivation 5 • Water for irrigation must be tested at least once/year for microbial, chemical and mineral pollution as well as for its pH, electrical conductivity, TDS, etc. Where water quality is unknown, proper practices that minimize the contact of water with edible portions should be followed: • Maintain water bodies to prevent surface run-off from contaminating water supply • Run-offs may be managed properly and undesired run- off may be diverted away from the farms while the desirable run-off water may be stored properly for increasing water use efficiency • Thorough cleaning of water reservoirs at least once annually • Adopt water management plan to optimize water usage and reduce wastage by reusing the system by maintaining irrigation equipment to ascertain efficient operation • Adopt minimum energy utilization techniques including", "meta": {"title": "Good Agricultural Practices for IPM in Protected Cultivation", "org": "National Centre for Integrated Pest Management (ICAR)", "year": "2010", "file": "“Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for IPM in Protected Cultivation” — National Centre for Integrated Pest Management (ICAR) Technical Bulletin No. 23 (2010).pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Inset photo (nematode infected plant) Technical Bulletin No. 23 6 • Bed preparation by building up rich flora of biological control agents, e.g.: Trichoderma spp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Paecilomyces lilacinus etc, for the management of soil borne pathogens especially nematodes – as the required levels of natural enemies and bioagents maintain a healthy ecosystem in greenhouses. Once this system disturbs the natural means to control, natural control options are virtually exhausted and the pests multiply unchecked in the absence of natural forces of suppression. Additionally one should follow following precautions: • Avoid/ repair faulty greenhouse structures which help in the entry of insect-pests • Always use insect-proof net screens • Greenhouses along with workers/visitors should have double entry gates so as to minimize the risk of pest entry Manure and Fertilizer Application • Avoid use of untreated manure and apply only properly composted or adequately aged manure from genuine compost suppliers before planting. Also, the compost may be mixed with the consortium of bioagents for proper mineralization as well as the multiplier effect of bioagents for effective control of soil borne pathogens • Clean equipment that comes in contact with untreated manure • Proper analysis of manure for heavy metals must be carried out before application • Always cover the manure and keep it away from garbage- contamination by pests • Do not apply manure when the produce is nearing maturity or being harvested • Store manure and fertilizer in a clean, dry location, separated from pesticides, and properly labelled to reduce the risk of environment contamination • Apply fertilizer based on crop nutrient requirements and available nutrients in soil • All fertilizer applications must be recorded Crop Protection Maintenance of crop health is essential for successful farming for both yield and quality of produce. Pest Monitoring measures such as sticky traps should always be in place for timely action. Unwanted visitors should be discouraged from entering the greenhouse.

It is highly successful in cucurbits like melons for resistance against diseases. Grafting involves the union of suitable varieties of greenhouse crops used as scions over the resistant rootstocks usually from the same family. Centre has conducted trials on grafting of tomato seedlings over the available rootstocks from different families. Although, the success has been achieved in grafting of greenhouse tomato over interfamilial plants, however, tomato and cucurbits only gave good results. Technology is underway and is proving to be promising for greenhouse cultivation in India. The grafted seedlings are conditioned (hardened) in the dark and cool shed nets prepared specially for the purpose before planting in seedling trays and finally their transplantation in the greenhouses. Grafting robots are being increasingly used for the commercial production of healthy nursery.

The present agricultural scenario is a mix of outstanding achievements and missed opportunities. If India has to emerge as an economic power in the world, our agricultural productivity should equal those countries, which are currently rated as economic power of the world. We need a new and effective technology which can improve continuously the productivity, profitability, sustainability of our major farming systems. One such technology is the green house technology. Although it is centuries old, it is new to India. Greenhouse Technology Growing plants is both an art and a science. About 95% of plants, either food crops or cash crops are grown in open field. Since time immemorial, man has learnt how to grow plants under natural environmental conditions. In some of the temperate regions where the climatic conditions are extremely adverse and no crops can be grown, man has developed methods of growing some high value crop continuously by providing protection from the excessive cold, which is called as Greenhouse Technology. So, Greenhouse Technology is the technique of providing favourable environment condition to the plants. It is rather used to protect the plants from the adverse climatic conditions such as wind, cold, precepitation, excessive radiation, extreme temperature, insects and diseases. It is also of vital importance to create an ideal micro climate around the plants. This is possible by erecting a greenhouse / glass house, where the environmental conditions are so modified that one can grow any plant in any place at any time by providing suitable environmental conditions with minimum labour. Greenhouses are framed or inflated structures covered with transparent or translucent material large enough to grow crops under partial or fully controlled environmental conditions to get optimum growth and productivity. Advantages of greenhouses : ♥ The yield may be 10-12 times higher than that of out door cultivation depending upon the type of greenhouse, type of crop, environmental control facilities. ♥ Reliability of crop increases under greenhouse cultivation. ♥ Ideally suited for vegetables and flower crops. ♥ Year round production of floricultural crops. ♥ Off-season production of vegetable and fruit crops. ♥ Disease-free and genetically superior transplants can be produced continuously. ♥ Efficient utilisation of chemicals, pesticides to control pest and diseases. ♥ Water requirement of crops very limited and easy to control. ♥ Maintenance of stock plants, cultivating grafted plant-lets and micro propagated plant-lets. ♥ Hardening of tissue cultured plants ♥ Production of quality produce free of blemishes. ♥ Most useful in monitoring and controlling the instability of various ecological system. ♥ Modern techniques of Hydroponic (Soil less culture), Aeroponics and Nutrient film techniques are possible only under greenhouse cultivation. GREENHOUSES – WORLD SCENARIO There are more than 50 countries now in the world where cultivation of crops is undertaken on a commercial scale under cover. United States of America has a total area of about 4000 ha under greenhouses mostly used for floriculture with a turnover of more than 2.8 billion US $ per annum and the area under greenhouses is expected to go up considerably, if the cost of transportation of vegetables from neighbouring countries continues to rise. The area under greenhouses in Spain has been estimated to be around 25,000 ha and Italy 18,500 ha used mostly for growing vegetable crops like watermelon, capsicum, strawberries, beans, cucumbers and tomatoes. In Spain simple tunnel type greenhouses are generally used without any elaborate environmental control equipments mostly using UV stabilised polyethylene film as cladding material. In Canada the greenhouse industry caters both to the flower and off-season vegetable markets. The main vegetable crops grown in Canadian greenhouses are tomato, cucumbers and capsicum. Hydroponically grown greenhouse vegetables in Canada find greater preference with the consumers and could be priced as much as twice the regular greenhouse produce. The Netherlands is the traditional exporter of greenhouse grown flowers and vegetables all over the world. With about 89,600 ha under cover, the Dutch greenhouse industry is probably the most advanced in the world. Dutch greenhouse industry however relies heavily on glass framed greenhouses, in order to cope up with very cloudy conditions prevalent all the year round. A very strong research and development component has kept the Dutch industry in the forefront. The development of greenhouses in Gulf countries is primarily due to the extremity in the prevailing climatic conditions. Israel is the largest exporter of cut flowers and has wide range of crops under greenhouses (15,000 ha) and Turkey has an area of 10,000 ha under cover for cultivation of cut flowers and vegetables.

In Saudi Arabia cucumbers and tomatoes are the most important crops contributing more than 94% of the total production. The most common cooling method employed in these areas is evaporative cooling. Egypt has about 1000 ha greenhouses consisting mainly of plastic covered tunnel type structures. Arrangements for natural ventilation are made for regulation of temperature and humidity conditions. The main crops grown in these greenhouses are tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, melons and nursery plant material. In Asia, China and Japan are the largest users of greenhouses. The development of greenhouse technology in China has been faster than in any other country in the world. With a modest beginning in late seventies, the area under greenhouses in China has increased to 48,000 ha in recent years. Out of this 11,000 ha is under fruits like grapes, cherry, japanese persimon, fig, loquot, lemon and mango. The majority of greenhouses use local materials for the frame and flexible plastic films for glazing. Most of the greenhouses in China are reported to be unheated and use straw mats to improve the heat retention characteristics. Japan has more than 40,000 ha under greenhouse cultivation of which nearly 7500 ha is devoted to only fruit orchards. Greenhouses in Japan are used to grow wide range of vegetables and flowers with a considerable share of vegetable demand being met from greenhouse production. Even a country like South Korea has more than 21,000 ha under greenhouses for production of flowers and fruits. Thus, greenhouses permit crop production in areas where winters are severe and extremely cold as in Canada and USSR, and also permit production even in areas where summers are extremely intolerable as in Israel, UAE, and Kuwait. Greenhouses in Philippines make it possible to grow crops inspite of excessive rains and also in moderate climates of several other countries. Thus, in essence greenhouse cultivation is being practiced and possible in all types of climatic conditions. Status in India While greenhouses have existed for more than one and a half centuries in various parts of the world, in India use of greenhouse technology started only during 1980’s and it was mainly used for research activities. This may be because of our emphasis, so far had been on achieving self-sufficiency in food grain production. However, in recent years in view of the globalization of international market and tremendous boost and fillip that is being given for export of agricultural produce, there has been a spurt in the demand for greenhouse technology. The National Committee on the use of Plastics in Agriculture (NCPA-1982) has recommended location specific trials of greenhouse technology for adoption in various regions of the country. Greenhouses are being built in the Ladakh region for extending the growing season of vegetables from 3 to 8 months. In the North-East, greenhouses are being constructed essentially as rain shelters to permit off-season vegetable production. In the Northern plains, seedlings of vegetables and flowers are being raised in the greenhouses either for capturing the early markets or to improve the quality of the seedlings. Propagation of difficult-to-root tree species has also been found to be very encouraging. Several commercial floriculture ventures are coming up in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka states to meet the demands of both domestic and export markets. The commercial utilization of greenhouses started from 1988 onwards and now with the introduction of Government’s liberalization policies and developmental initiatives, several corporate houses have entered to set up 100% export oriented units. In just four years, since implementation of the new policies in 1991, 103 projects with foreign investment of more than Rs.80 crores have been approved to be set up in the country at an estimated cost of more than Rs.1000 crores around Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi. Thus the area under climatically controlled greenhouses of these projects is estimated to be around 300 ha. Out of which many have already commenced exports and have received very encouraging results in terms of the acceptance of the quality in major markets abroad and the price obtained.", "meta": {"title": "Low-Cost Greenhouses for Vegetable Production", "org": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU)", "year": "2020", "file": "“Low Cost Green Houses for Vegetable Production” — Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU).pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Classification of greenhouses: Greenhouse structure of various types are used for crop production. Although there are advantages in each type for a particular application, in general there is no single type greenhouse, which can be constituted as the best. Different types of greenhouses are designed to meet the specific needs. The different types of greenhouses based on shape, utility, material and construction are briefly given below: 1. Greenhouse type based on shape: For the purpose of classification, the uniqueness of cross section of the greenhouses can be considered as a factor. The commonly followed types of greenhouses based on shape are: a) Lean to type greenhouse. b) Even span type greenhouse. c) Uneven span type greenhouse. d) Ridge and furrow type. e) Saw tooth type. f) Quonset greenhouse. g) Interlocking ridges and furrow type Quonset greenhouse. h) Ground to ground greenhouse. 2. Greenhouse type based on Utility Classification can be made depending on the functions or utilities. Of the different utilities, artificial cooling and heating are more expensive and elaborate. Hence based on this, they are classified in to two types. a) Greenhouses for active heating. b) Greenhouses for active cooling. 3. Greenhouse type based on construction The type of construction predominantly is influenced by structural material, though the covering material also influence the type. Higher the span, stronger should be the material and more structural members are used to make sturdy tissues. For smaller spans, simple designs like hoops can be followed. So based on construction, greenhouses can be classified as a) Wooden framed structure. b) Pipe framed structure. c) Truss framed structure. 4. Greenhouse type based on covering material Covering materials are the important component of the greenhouse structure. They have direct influence on greenhouse effect, inside the structure and they alter the air temperature inside. The types of frames and method of fixing also varies with covering material. Hence based on the type of covering material they may be classified as a) Glass glazing. b) Fibre glass reinforced plastic (FRP) glazing i. Plain sheet ii. Corrugated sheet. c) Plastic film i. UV stabilized LDPE film. ii. Silpaulin type sheet. iii. Net house. d) Based on the cost of construction involved ( which includes various factors mentioned from a to c ) i High cost Green House ii Medium cost Green House iii Low cost Green House The structural requirements and the cost per unit area for different models of low cost green houses for cultivation of vegetables are detailed below with diagrams to enable an interested enterprenur to construct a low cost green house on his own accord. However, the local weather conditions and the individuals necessity play a major role in the selection of the model. Cost Economics of High Cost Greenhouse High cost green house may be a multispan structure. The cost estimates may vary considerably due to crop, cladding material and environmental control system.

Material: peg, rope, measuring tape, bamboo stick/ 6 mm GI rod, insect proof net, notebook, pen, pencil, etc Introduction: In India, protected cultivation technology for commercial production is hardly three decades old. In a country like ours, where most of the structural designs have been adopted from different countries, the designs have been amply modified to suit the local conditions and requirements of different agro-climatic areas. The commonly used protected structures are as follows: Low Tunnel: Also called ‗miniature greenhouses‘, low tunnels ( approximately 4 feet tall and 3 to 6 feet wide) generally cover rows of plants in field and, therefore, they are also known as row covers. Clean plastic films or nets are stretched over low wire hoops (high, steel wires or bamboo strips or cane) to protect plants against frost, wind, insects and pests. These hoops are covered by polythene sheets of about 50 microns thickness and are provided with ventilation holes on the side opposite to the solar movement. Low tunnels provide a passive control of plant micro climate, i.e., use of specific plastic material to control radiation and provision of natural ventilation. Plastic mulches and drip irrigation may be used in conjunction with low tunnels. Walk-in tunnel: It is a temporary structure made by using GI pipes or bamboo, and is covered with different cladding material depending upon the season in which the cultivation is proposed Optimum size of the walking tunnel is 60–75 sq m, with 2–2.5 m width and up to 30 m length with a 2–2.5 m central height. Overall, the height is enough for the worker to walk comfortably during operation. Net Houses: Depending upon the cladding (covering) material used, the net houses may be classified as insect-proof net houses and shade net houses. An insect-proof net house can be fabricated as a temporary or permanent structure in different designs. It can be in a walkin tunnel design and shape, with double door facility at one end of the structure. It is covered with UV-stabilised insect-proof net of 40–50 mesh for effective control of pests and diseases. The minimum size of insect-proof net house is 100 sq m. Protected Cultivation Shade Net House: It is primarily constructed to protect plants from highly intense solar radiation. The structure is made of wood, stone, bamboo or GI pipes. When wood or bamboo are used, the poles are treated with turpentine and tar on one side before inserting them in the ground. Cladding material used on the top and sides of the structure is generally a shade net. The shade nets are available in different colours with different percentages of shade factor. Greenhouse: It is a framed or covered structure with a transparent or translucent material which permits ample sunlight for crop production and has provisions for at least partial control of plant environment. As a result of this, a part of the solar energy is continually retained in the greenhouse, leading to a temperature increase. During summers, the greenhouses are cooled as per the crop requirement. Air humidity in the greenhouse can also be increased or lowered.. In general, crops in greenhouses are either grown on beds or in pots irrigated by micro- irrigation systems. Mist Chamber: The main purpose of such a structure is to create high humidity and droplet-free presence of water for propagating delicate soft wood cuttings, vegetable crops, root plants and shrubs, etc. A mist chamber of 15–25 sq m is sufficient for a nursery. The frequency of misting depends upon ambient temperature and type of", "meta": {"title": "Protected Cultivation & Post-Harvest Technology", "org": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU)", "year": "2020", "file": "“Protected Cultivation & Post-Harvest Technology” — TNAU manual.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Covering with cladding materia Protected Cultivation Conclusions: Protected Cultivation Practical No.: 02 TITLE: STUDY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF GREENHOUSES Objective: To study different types of greenhouse based on shape construction and cladding material and collect information about the following. Materials required: measuring tape, notebook, pen, pencil, etc Agro climatic conditions vary according to geographical locations. It is necessary to ensure the design of greenhouse meets the requirement of the peculiar agro climatic conditions. Therefore the type of greenhouse varies according to the climatic conditions of the area and utility of greenhouse. Greenhouses can be classified based on different parameters. 1. Classification based on shape: i. Lean to design, ii. Even span design, iii. Uneven span design, iv. Ridge and furrow, v. Quonset design, vi. Saw tooth design 1.1 Lean to design: Lean to design greenhouses are categorized as attached greenhouses and are placed against the side of existing wall preferably south wall of a building. This design maximizes the availability of sunlight with minimum constructional materials as the roof supports required are less. The roof of the building is extended with appropriate greenhouse covering material and the area is properly enclosed. 1.2 Even span: This design involves the two roof slopes of a greenhouse with equal pitch and width are attached to make a single roof. Construction of small greenhouses can follow this design. Several single and multiple span types are available for use in various regions of India. By using this deign the rainwater can slide off the roofs automatically. 1.3 Uneven span design: This type of design can be adopted to construct greenhouse on hilly terrain. The two roof slopes of different width form the single roof of the greenhouse. 1.4 Ridge and furrow: Design of ridge and furrow type greenhouse involves connecting two or more A- frame along its length of the eave. The eave serves as the furrow or gutter to carry rain water away. The side walls at the joints are eliminated which provides large interior space inside the greenhouse. 1.5 Quonset design: This type of greenhouse is constructed by using pipe arches or trusses for support. The pipelines run along the length of greenhouse. The greenhouse is covered by polyethylene sheet. These houses are connected either in free standing style or arranged in a interlocking ridge and furrow. 1.6 Saw tooth design: Green houses with Saw tooth design have rooftops in the shape similar to teeth of a saw. It is similar to ridge and furrow type except there is provision for natural ventilation in this type greenhouse. 2. Classification based on cladding material i. Glass green houses ii. Plastic film greenhouses iii. Rigid panel greenhouses 2.1 Glass greenhouses: Glass as covering material has the advantage of greater interior light intensity. These greenhouses have higher infiltration air rate, which leads to lower interior humidity and better disease Protected Cultivation prevention. Lean to type, even span, ridge and furrow type of designs are used for construction glass greenhouse. 2.2 Plastic film greenhouses: Flexible plastic films including polyethylene, polyester and polyvinyl chloride are used as covering material in this type of greenhouses. Plastics as covering material for greenhouse have become popular, as they are cheap and cost of heating is less when compared to glass greenhouses. The main disadvantage with plastic films is its short life as the covering material. For example, the best quality ultraviolet stabilized films can last for four years only. 2.3 Rigid panel greenhouses: Polyvinyl chloride rigid panels, fiber glass-reinforced plastic, acrylic and polycarbonate rigid panels are employed as the covering material in this type of greenhouses.

These panels can be used in the Quonset type frames or ridge and furrow type frames. This material is more resistant to breakage and the light intensity is uniform throughout the greenhouse compared to glass or plastic. High grade panels have long life even up to 20 years. The main disadvantage is that these panels tend to collect dust as well as to harbor algae, which results in darkening of the panels and subsequent reduction in the light transmission. There is significant danger of fire hazard. 3.1 Classification based on construction i.Wooden framed structures ii. Pipe framed structures iii. Truss framed structures 3.1 Wooden framed structures: In general, for greenhouses with span less than 6 m, only wooden framed structures are used. Side posts and columns are constructed of wood without use of a truss. Pine wood is commonly used as it is inexpensive and possesses the required strength. Timber locally available, with good strength, durability and machinability also can be used for construction. 3.2 Pipe framed structures: When the clear span is around 12 m, pipes are use for the construction of greenhouse. In general, the side posts, columns, cross ties and purlins are constructed using pipes. Trusses are not used in this type of greenhouse also. 3.3 Truss framed structures: If the greenhouse span is greater than or equal to 15 m, truss frames are used. Flat steel, tubular steel or angle iron is welded together to form a truss encompassing rafters, chords and struts. Struts are support members under tension. Angle iron purlins running throughout the length of greenhouse are bolted to each truss. Columns are used only in very wide truss frame houses of 21.3 m or more. Most of the glass houses are of truss frame type, as these frames are best suited for pre-fabrication.

Other major considerations involve shape of the roof, the material of roof etc. the design should be such that the angle of incidence of solar radiation is never greater than 40ºC. The structural design of greenhouse must provide safety from wind and other loads while permitting maximum light transmission to the crops. The framing members should be minimum size consistent with providing adequate strength to resist anticipated loads over the expected life of the structure. The various load should be considered to produce structurally sound and economical useful greenhouse. Design load calculations: It is essential to consider all loads while erecting the greenhouse. The design of greenhouse structure is mainly governed by the dead load, live load, wind load and snow loads. 1. Dead loads are the weights of all materials (such as frame, covering material etc.) used in the construction of greenhouse. 2. Live loads are the weights superimposed by use (in greenhouse would include hanging baskets, vine ropes etc.). The minimum value of this is taken as 50 kg/sq.m in non-snow zones. In cooler areas the snow load may be added to this. 3. Wind loads are those caused by wind blowing any horizontal direction i.e. load due", "meta": {"title": "Protected Cultivation & Post-Harvest Technology", "org": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU)", "year": "2020", "file": "“Protected Cultivation & Post-Harvest Technology” — TNAU manual.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

The minimum value of this is taken as 100 kg/sq.m on vertically project area below 9.14metre height. 4. Snow loads are vertical loads applied to the horizontal projection of the building roof. Site selection  The soil should have a pH of of 5.5 to 6.5 and EC of 0.5 to 0.7 ms/cm  Availability of continuous source of quality water (pH of 5.5 7.0 and EC should be less than 1 ms/cm)  The site of construction should be elevated than the surrounding land.  Transportation facility  Land availability for future expansion Orientation: Orientation of greenhouse depends up on light intensity, wind direction and wind velocity.  Single span – East west orientation  Multi span – north south orientation  The opening of the top vent should be towards leeward side.  Lengthwise slope – 0 to 2%  Maximum width of greenhouse – 40 m Materials: The selection of materials depends on its density, allowable stresses and economics. Initially wood and woo piped structures were common. Trusses, columns, beams or purlins made of these materials have different load bearing capabilities and in most instances, if maintained would remain sound. There are various materials available for fabricating the structure of greenhouse. The most commonly used are 1) wood 2) Steel 3) Aluminum Protected Cultivation Wood: This is very common where the cost of wood is comparatively very low and is available in plenty. The construction of structure is also simple as local artisans are able to complete the jobs. It is easy to construct greenhouse with wood structure. Steel: Today, in construction of greenhouse high tensile strength pipes and tubular steel pipes (galvanized) are widely used. There has been a considerable development in construction of greenhouse. Galvanized steel or zinc coated pipes are preferred to avoid corrosion. All parts of the structure are made with 2 mm thick galvanized pipe or galvanized iron. Aluminum: It is light in weight, easy to handle and not adversely affected by most greenhouse conditions. Aluminum pipes, angles, channels and T sections are commercially available. These can be used for trusses, purlins and columns.

First of all, it is important to select ‗well drained‘ soil for growing plants (like loam, red soil). The height of the bed should be equal, about 30–45 cm from the ground, with a width of 74–100 cm. The width of the path between two beds should be 50 cm. These beds are good for better aeration and drainage and are more common in greenhouse cultivation.The beds can be any length, but it is convenient to break them up with crosspaths to facilitate access and to avoid the temptation to walk across them. In this way, each bed will be accessible from a path on all two sides. Raised beds are built up higher than the surrounding paths. In many ways this is a logical progression from the decision to go for no- dig cultivation. It is often referred to as intensive raised bed gardening, because it can result in significantly higher yields. Bed Preparation Procedure: The soil in the bed may first be loosened with a fork, as a one-off cultivation. At the same time remove any large stone. Remember, the aim is to clear the topsoil only. Ignore stones below 6 inches (15 cm), as these assist drainage. The same applies to old roots. The paths around the bed are now created, defined with a string line attached to wooden stakes. Dig out 15-20 cm of soil and drop this on to the bed, which is thereby raised. As you do so, break this soil into a reasonable tilth. Do not dig the path too deeply, as this will make a trench, which will be difficult to work in and maintain. The beds can be given a convex slope or can be flat, but it is recommend for flat-topped bed because this will reduce moisture loss by limiting the surface area and will also make for ease of working and spreading of compost manure. Sloping sides tend always to be falling into the pathways. Finally, spread organic matter over the bed. With the bed system this will go further, since it is being confined to the intensively cultivated bed surfaces alone, not spread over the whole vegetable plot. In time the beds will slump a little, but you will never 'lose' them, and they will, of course, be raised annually by the application of organic mulch.

Protected Cultivation Practical No.: 07 TITLE: RAISING OF SEEDLINGS AND SAPLINGS UNDER PROTECTED CONDITIONS Objective: To study the method of raising seedlings and saplings under protected conditions Theory: Nursery is prepared to raise saplings / seedlings as a pre-requisite for establishment of a garden. The nursery operations are specific and needs lot of care. A well prepared nursery can help in production of good saplings through stem cuttings or raising of seedlings through sowing of seeds. Nursery raised in rich soils can help in better growth of the saplings / seedling. Materials Required: Bill hook / Secateur / garden implements / Measuring tape, Sand, Well decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM), Rope, Bavistin, (Dichlorovinyl Dimethyl Phosphate ) DDVP, Gunny cloth. Experiment procedure: Stem cuttings / seeds have specific requirements for developing into saplings / seedlings. The advantage of raising saplings / seedlings in a nursery is that it is possible to develop rooted plants for taking up new plantation and also to raise grafts. More attention is required to grow saplings / seedlings in a nursery to get better survival and growth. Steps: Select a land which is flat and near to the source of irrigation. Dig the land to a depth of 30 cm thoroughly and remove the weeds/ stone pebbles/old roots etc. Prepare raised beds of dimension 18 m (Length) x 1.06 m (Width) x 30 cm (Height) or any convenient size (Fig. 1.1). Apply about 60 kg sand and 30 kg FYM per bed and mix them with the soil thoroughly. Level the nursery beds with a piece of wood and make them ready for planting. Layout drip irrigation pipes a) For Raising Saplings in the Nursery Beds : Healthy and disease free seedlings of 30-45 days, 8-15cm height with 5-6 leaves are used for transplanting. Planting should always be done during evening Treat the saplings in 1% Dithane M- 45 solution for about 30 minutes to avoid fungal diseases. Mark the bed at row to row distance of 30 cm or any convenient distance (Fig. 2.1). Protected Cultivation Plant the saplingsin row to row and plant to plant spacing of 30cm or any convenient spacing. b) For Raising Seedlings in the Nursery Beds: In case seedlings are to be raised by sowing seeds, a line of 1 cm deep is drawn at 20 cm apart in the nursery bed and seeds are sown in the line at 3 cm spacing. Seeds can also be broadcasted in the nursery and covered with a thin layer of soil and sand mixture and later on thinning operation can be done to reduce the plant density. Fig.1.1. Preparation of nursery bed; Fig.1.2: uniform and healthy saplings raised in nursery bed c) Maintenance: Irrigate the nursery beds immediately after planting the cutting or sowing the seeds and subsequently as and when required depending upon moisture availability. Remove weeds manually from the nursery beds 30-45 days after planting of cuttings or sowing of seeds without disturbing the cuttings/ seedlings. Spray 0.1% Bavistin solution for controlling fungal diseases in the nursery. Spray 0.2 % Tafagor, Bavistineat 7-10 days intervals for controlling the pests. The saplings shall be ready for transplanting after a period of 30-45 days (Fig.2.2). Uproot the saplings carefully without damaging the root system. Irrigate the nursery before uprooting the saplings. Plant the saplings immediately in field after uprooting. If not planted immediately, keep uprooted saplings under shade and cover them with wet gunny cloth/sprinkle water at regular intervals..

Protected Cultivation Protected Cultivation Practical No.: 08 TITLE: USE OF PROTRAYS IN QUALITY PLANTING MATERIAL PRODUCTION Introduction: The protrays raising technology is aimed to produce disease free, vigorous and season independent seedlings using protected environment. Depending on the objective, different types of protected structures like greenhouse, net house and portable low poly tunnels are used to take care of biotic and abiotic stresses during period of raising seedlings Objective: To raise quality and disease free seedlings in protrays Materials required: Paper sheet and pen to note down the instructions, seeds of crop, plugtrays/protrays, cocopeat, vermiculite, perlite etc. Advantages of Pro-trays: 1. Proper germination 2. Provide independent area for each seed to germinate 3. Reduce mortality rate 4. Maintain uniform and healthy growth of seedlings 5. Easy to handle and store 6. Reliable and economical in transportation Rooting medium Ingredients: Mostly artificial soil-less media is used for raising healthy and vigorous seedlings of vegetable in plastic pro-trays. Combination of 3 ingredients like cocopeat, vermiculite and horticultural perlite are used as root medium for raising the nursery. These ingredients are mixed in 3:1:1 ratio before filling in the required containers. Media contains coarser textured peat provide better drainage and aeration promoting, therefore, better root development of transplants. Procedure of raising seedlings in Protrays: A. Sowing of seeds: Use true type seed. Protected Cultivation One seed per cell is sown. Sow seeds at shallow depth (0.5 cm) after pressing the media with finger in a gentle way into the potting plug or cells. The trays are filled with slightly moist media. After sowing, a layer of vermiculite is given to cover the seeds for better germination- good water holding capacity. The trays are shifted to polyhouse/net house. The trays are irrigated lightly every day depending upon the prevailing weather conditions by using a fine drip irrigation setup. Drenching the trays with fungicides as a precautionary measure against seedling mortality can also be done. Application of water soluble NPK fertilizer(25g/l) through drip irrigation setup on weekly interval. Seedlings are ready for transplanting after 20-30 days of sowing in trays. The internal environment of the polyhouses also affects the growth and development of the emerging seedlings. To get healthy seedlings the temperature should be maintained at 20-30°C. Growth regulators like cycocel @ 5-10 ppm can be sprayed at 3-4 leaf stage. The seedlings at right stage of planting are hardened by withholding irrigation before transplanting or selling to the growers. B. Disease control : ● Sanitation by controlling weeds inside the nursery greenhouse. ● Disinfect the trays by dipping in sodium hypochloride solution of 0.1 per cent before reuse of sowing has to be ensured. ● Ventilation is the best method of preventing damping off and foliar fungal diseases. ● Transplants can be treated with captan @ 0.2 per cent solution or by application of bavistin @ 0.1 per cent to the seedlings. C. Hardening of seedlings: ● It is necessary to reduce transplanting shock. ● Plants should be gradually hardened by acclimatizing them to the anticipated growing conditions of the fields. ● It is done at least a week before planting. ● It can be done by slowing down their growth rate so that they can withstand chilling, drying winds, shortage of water, or high temperatures.

Fig. 3.6: Seedlings of chilli in pro-trays Fig. 3.7: Seedlings of tomato in pro-trays Ideal conditions for transplanting: Transplanting is done when the weather is cloudy, cool and moist. During sunny days, transplanting is preferred late in the afternoon to allow the seedlings to recover at the low temperature of the night. Procedure for transplanting: Holes are made in the main field with the help of a khurpi or a shovel at a specified distance for a crop. One seedling is placed in each hole. Cover its roots with soil firmly. The seedlings of crops are transplanted on a flat bed or on sides of ridges. When planted on a flat bed, ridges and furrow are made after the seedlings set firmly. Irrigation should be done immediately after transplanting. In the initial stages, seedlings are transplanted at the side of ridges, and later, earthling up is done to bring the plant in the centre of the ridges. However, raised bed planting system is becoming popular. Beds of 15–20 cm height and 1.2 m width, irrespective of length, are prepared. These beds are either furrow irrigated or drip Protected Cultivation irrigated. Polythene mulching is another intervention to minimise weeds and save water. Irrigation is preferably localised along plant rows, leaving areas between the rows dry for transplanting operation. This is possible with furrow and drip irrigation but not with sprinkle irrigation. Irrigate the field 2–3 days before transplanting, if the soil is sandy or sandy loam. In case of clayey soils, irrigate 5–6 days prior to transplanting. Light irrigation is necessary immediately after transplanting for better field stand of seedlings. Time of transplanting: In India, these can be grown throughout the year in areas where winters are less severe. Kharif season crops, like tomato, brinjal and chilli are sown in June– July and transplanted in the months of July–August. Rabi or winter season crops are sown in September– October and transplanted in November–December. For summer crops, seeds are sown in January–February and transplanted in February– March. Transplanting shock: Transplanting shock means temporary retardation in growth or subsequent mortality of seedlings just after transplanting. This can be prevented by hardening of the seedlings by withholding water for 3–5 days before transplanting. Seedlings can recover easily if watered frequently for about a week after transplanting. Exercise: Demonstrate the transplanting of seedlings Procedure: Activity 1: Prepare a suitable layout (flat bed or ridges and furrows) for planting. Activity 2: Mark the location for planting seedings at suitable spacing Activity 3: Make holes at the point of planting with the help of a khurpi or shovel Activity 4: Place one uprooted seedling in each hole.

Protected Cultivation Protected Cultivation Practical No. : 11 TITTLE: MONITORING OF pH AND EC OF RAISED BED SOIL Objective: To determination and monitoring of electrical conductivity and pH raised bed soil Determination of soil electrical conductivity: The conductivity or more precisely the specific conductance of a soil at a given soil-water ratio is the reciprocal of the specific resistance offered by the solution at 25°C between the electrodes of 1 sq cm cross section kept 1 cm apart. Thus, the electrical conductivity of any solution depends on the amount of soluble salt present in it. Knowledge on the extent of salinity is important for management of saline soil including the choice of the crop suitable for that soil. Soluble salt content in saturation extract is more reliable index of salinity level than in soil: water ratio of 1: 2 or 1: 2.5 because it simulates the extent of salinity experienced by crop in field moisture condition.

Reagents: Standard potassium chloride solution, 0.01 N: Dissolve 0.7456 g of AR grade potassium chloride (KC1) and make up volume to 1 liter with distilled water. The EC25 of 0.01 N KC1 solution is 1.413 dS/m. Principle: A simple Wheatstone bridge principle (except the type of current) is used for the measurement of EC of the soil solution, as EC of any solution is directly proportional to the concentration of soluble salt.

Protected Cultivation Determination of soil pH: Equipment’s and Materials: pH meter with glass and calomel reference electrode, 100 and 500 ml beaker, glass rod. Introduction: The soil pH value is the measure of hydrogen or hydroxyl ion activity in the soil solution and it indicates whether the soil is acidic, neutral or alkaline in reaction. The pH is the most important property of soil as it controls the availability of plant nutrients, microbial activity and physical condition of soil Since crop growth is affected both under very low (strongly acidic) and very high (strongly alkaline) soil pH, reclamation of these soils are necessary. Soil pH in fact indicates the extent of active acidity (activity of hydrogen ion in soil solution) of soil. Depending upon the purpose of measurement and soil condition, soil pH is measured in several soil-water or soil-salt solution ratios. The saturated paste is used for identifying specific soil problems like degree of acidity or alkalinity. The soil pH value is independent of dilution over a wide range of soil-salt solution ratio, thus more reproducible than those obtained with soil-water suspension. Reagents: Standard buffer solutions: Certified buffer tablets are available for different pH values. Buffer tablets of pH 4.0, 7.0 and 9.2 are mostly used for pH meter calibration. Dissolve one tablet in specified volume (usually 100 ml) of water and preserve in refrigerator Procedure 1) Sample Preparation Soil - water suspension  Take 20 g processed air dry soil in 100 ml beaker and add 40 mL(for 1: 2 soil - water ratio) or 50 mL (for 1: 2.5 soil - water ratio) of distilled water.  Stir the soil with glass rod occasionally for about 30 minutes. 2) pH Determination • Switch on the pH meter and allow it to warm up for half an hour. • Set the temperature of the instrument at room temperature by turning temperature set knob. • Calibrate the pH meter with three buffer solutions, one in acidic range (usually pH 4.0), one in alkaline range (usually pH 9.2) and other in neutral (pH 7.0) by using calibration knob. • During each transition wash the electrodes thoroughly with distilled water and soak the adhering water with tissue paper.

There are several approaches for scheduling irrigation based on crops, soil, atmosphere and plant water relations. Objective: To study about regulation of drip irrigation Equipment require: Moisture sensor, core cutter, scale, weight balance, pan evaporimeter Methodology: Estimation of Moisture Depletion: According to soil moisture depletion concept, the water content at FC is considered 100 per cent available for crop growth and that at PWP is 0 per cent. The safe limit of allowable soil water depletion for a crop is determined by experimentation and taken as criterion for scheduling irrigation. Values for FC and B.D. are determined layer wise of a soil profile to work out the moisture deficit with the formula: Based on this principle a large number of irrigation experiments have been conducted and it was observed that most of the crops like wheat, barley, maize, bajra and sunflower can resist the moisture stress upto 50% of available water in the root zone. Example: In an irrigation trial on wheat, irrigation is to be scheduled at 20, 40, 60 and 80 per cent available soil water in 0-30 cm depth. If the FC is 28 per cent and PWP is 12 per cent, calculate the moisture present at which irrigations would be scheduled under different irrigation treatments. Solution: I1 = Irrigation at 20% ASW = (28-12) x 20 / 100 + 12 = 15.2% I2 = Irrigation at 40% ASW = (28-12) x 40 / 100 + 12 = 18.4% I3 = Irrigation at 60% ASW = (28-12) x 60 / 100 + 12 = 21.6% I4 = Irrigation at 80% ASW = (28-12) x 80 / 100 + 12 = 24.8% Protected Cultivation Scheduling of irrigation based on IW /CPE ratio approach: According to the recent concept water requirement of crops is dependent upon climatic parameters and therefore, the cumulative pan evaporation values are used for scheduling irrigation. It is well known that the consumptive use of water is a physical phenomena governed by the incident energy at a place and is not a physiological process. Based on this fact, the climatological approach of scheduling irrigation has been developed and it involves the depth of irrigation water (IW) and the cumulative pan evaporation (CPE). The ratio IW/CPE serves as a soil moisture stress index. The lower the ratio, the more will be the stress and vice-versa.

Solution: Protected Cultivation Protected Cultivation Parctical No. :14 TITLE: STUDY OF AGROCHEMICALS AVAILABLE FOR POLYHOUSE Objectives: Material required: notebook, pen, fertilisers and practical file Introduction: Most greenhouse operations apply soluble fertilisers through irrigation systems, thus the use of the term ‗fertigation‘. This is accomplished by drip (pipes) where soluble fertilisers are injected using injectors at a calculated quantity of concentrated solution (stock solution) into the irrigation line so that the water from the hose (dilute solution) carries as much fertiliser as planned. Fertigation provides not only greater resource optimisation, but also better adaptability for suitable placement and delivery of inputs, thereby increasing nutrient uptake efficiency, predictability, precision as per the requirement of the plant or the media formulations. Fertilisers Suitable for Fertigation: 1. Nitrogen Sources: Nitrogen is the predominant element used in any kind of fertigation, including the ones used in greenhouses, as plants require it in large quantities besides being highly mobile across different phases of biogeochemical cycles. Major sources of nitrogen, along with information on their use in fertigation are given below: Ammonium Phosphate: It may lead to lowering of pH and soil acidification. High calcium or magnesium in the water for irrigation causes precipitate formations and it can choke the drip emitters and drip lines. Ammonium Sulphate: It is an inorganic soil supplement that benefits especially in alkaline soils. It tends to be acid forming, which could be a disadvantage if greenhouse media is acidic. Ammonium Thio-sulphate: It is used both as a fertiliser and as an acidulating (which makes it slightly acidic) agent. Calcium Ammonium Nitrate: It is high in fast acting nitrate-nitrogen, low in lasting ammonium nitrogen, and supplies calcium. Calcium ammonium nitrate may be combined with ammonium nitrate, magnesium nitrate, potassium nitrate and potassium chloride. Calcium Nitrate: It is soluble in water and causes only a slight shift in the soil or water pH. Urea Ammonium Nitrate: Nitrogen is available in three forms — nitrate nitrogen, urea nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen. The nitrate portion is immediately available as soon as it reaches the root zone. The urea portion moves freely with the soil water until it is hydrolysed by the urease enzyme responsible for the formation of ammonium nitrogen. Urea Sulphuric Acid: It is well suited for fertigation. Urea sulphuric acid is an acidic fertiliser, which combines urea and sulphuric acid. Protected Cultivation 2. Phosphorus Sources: Monoammonium phosphate, di-ammonium phosphate, monobasic potassium phosphate, ammonium polyphosphate, urea phosphate and phosphoric acid are some of the most common phosphate carrying water-soluble fertilisers Ammonium Nitrate: It is a liquid fertiliser mainly used as a source of nitrogen in greenhouses. It is available in two forms of nitrogen — the nitrate-nitrogen form (mobile and instantly available) and ammonium-nitrogen (the longer lasting, as micro-organisms convert it to the nitrate form). The major phosphorus sources along with information on their use in fertigation are as follows: Ammonium Polyphosphate: If the water being used has high buffering capacity (high carbonate/bicarbonate content generally with high pH, i.e., > 8.0) along with a high calcium and/or magnesium content, possibilities of precipitation in drips becomes very high. Diammonium Phosphate (DAP): DAP is a boon under situations of high alkalinity and indeed many greenhouses face this problem. Mono-Ammonium Phosphate (MAP): It provides nitrogen in ammonia forms that is taken up by the plants readily. Monobasic Potassium Phosphate: Also known as monopotassium phosphate, it provides good quantity of phosphorus along with potassium. Phosphoric Acid: It can be used in many formulations of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium mixtures. Being a good source of phosphorus, it provides additional advantage of keeping the pH of input injections low and helps in avoiding precipitation. Urea Phosphate: It is a good source of both phosphorus as well as nitrogen. It provides nitrogen in the form of urea. It is basically acidic in nature and highly suitable for acidifying water and soil. 3. Potassium Sources: The potassium sources most often used in drip irrigation systems are potassium chloride (KCl) and potassium nitrate (KNO3). Potassium phosphates are avoided for injection into drip irrigation systems.

Major sources of potassium sources along with their uses in fertigation are given below: Potassium Chloride: Potassium is supplemented by using potassium chloride as it is highly soluble and inexpensive. Potassium Nitrate: It is costly, but provides both nitrogen and potassium simultaneously. Potassium nitrate is advisable to use with irrigation water where salinity problems exist as it has a low salt index. Potassium Sulphate: Notes It can easily be used in place of potassium chloride in high-saline areas and simultaneously presents a source of sulphur. Potassium Thio-sulphate (KTS):Two grades of potassium thio-sulphate are available and are neutral to basic, chloride-free, clear liquid solution. It is blended with other fertilisers, but KTS mixed should not be acidified below pH 6.0.

Some factors to decide on the injector equipment required for regulating Fertigation in drips are: quantity of fertilizer to be applied duration of applications proportion of fertilizers starting and finishing time Most growers use injectors of one type or other for applying fertilizers to greenhouse crops. Injectors ―inject‖ a specific amount of concentrated fertilizer solution (stock solution) per increment of irrigation water that passes through the injector. An important attribute of each fertilizer injector is the injector ratio, which is defined as volumetric ratio of stock solution to dilute fertilizer solution. Injector ratio – the volumetric ratio of stock solution to dilute fertilizer solution. Popular injector types: 1. Pressure differential (by-pass tank) 2. Vacuum injection (Venturi) – very popular 3. Pump injection – very precise Methodology: Determination of particular fertilizer quantity for required PPM at the root zone: Protected Cultivation 1. Step one in any Fertigation program is to first have a soil and water analysis done for determining the EC, pH and quantities that may be present of minerals in your water and soil. 2. Second step is to determine the nutrient rates your crop requires. You can use recommendations from the literature, or your own experience. If nutrient requirements are provided in units other than ppm or mg/l, it is recommended to convert the values to ppm (1ppm = 1 mg/l). Deduct the soil water test results from the nutrient requirements of the crop for each required nutrient. For example, if magnesium requirement is 60 ppm and the source water contains 40 ppm, and then 60-40=20 ppm of magnesium has to be added to each liter of nutrient solution. Fertilizer Selection: Farmer needs to go through all Fertilizers available with him or in nearby store. And then select ones which contain all nutrients needed to be added. Begin with the fertilizer that contains a unique nutrient that other fertilizers do not contain. For example, if the only available source of calcium you have is calcium nitrate, start the calculation with this fertilizer.Now we come to nuclear question. By now farmers has decided on what should be fertilizer ppm in the drip solution delivered to his plants. Calculate Fertilizer Amounts: The formula allows you to calculate the amount of fertilizer needed to mix stock solutions. This formula can be used with any injector ratio, any desired concentration of diluted fertilizer solution and for all common units of measurement. ppm calculations Note: 1. Dilution factor is the reverse of injector ratio i.e. if injector ratio is 1:100, the dilution ratio is 100. 2. K is a conversion constant depending on the units used. 3. K = 75 if units are ounces per gallon 4. K = 1200 if units are pounds per gallon and 5. K = 10 if units are grams per liter. Example: Farmer has an injector with a 1:200 ratio and a fertilizer with an analysis of 20-20-20. He wants to apply 150-ppm nitrogen as a constant feed. How many ounces of fertilizer would he have to weigh out to make 1 gallon of stock solution? 1. Given  Desired concentration = 150 ppm  Injector ratio = 1:200; dilution factor = 200  Fertilizer analysis = 20-20-20 (20-percent nitrogen)  Ounces of fertilizer to make 1 gal. of stock solution = X (unknown)  Units: ounces per gallon.

Protected Cultivation Protected Cultivation Practical no. : 16 TITLE: OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF FOGGER Introduction: Fogging system, one of the developing technologies, is evaporative cooling technology. The most critical components of the system are the fog nozzles. Programmable logic controller (PLC) and high pressure pumps are used in addition to these components which are located in the air channels in the special formation. Objective: To understand procedure for operation and maintenance of fogger. Principal operation of fogger: The system works by feeding the inlet air with fine water droplets. Drips can be of different sizes depending on the duration of evaporation in the expected ambient conditions. These systems, generally between 20 and 40 microns, pass through high-pressure demineralized water atomization nozzles. Then the water is thrown from the tits. Fogging system is fairly effective and uniform method of greenhouse cooling that provides a reasonable increase in relative humidity inside greenhouse. Materials and methodology: Foggers are connected to lateral with micro-tube and it is hanging over iron wire in greenhouse (3 m above). Misters are attached to stakes in beds. Foggers and misters spray about 70 micron size of water in air and evaporated before falling onto the crop canopy. Foggers and misters are equipped with an anti-leak devices which does not allow flow of water droplets to fall down after the system is switched off. They have small discharge rate with small area coverage. The operating pressure of fogger and mister varies from 3 to 5 kg/cm2 .Generally the time of operation of foggers and misters are 30 to 60 sec, three or four times in an hour at specific time interval. Fig: Components of foggers used for fogging in greenhouse. Operating Procedure Plug the machine into an appropriate power source as specified on the machine identification label. Protected Cultivation Turn the machine power switch to the ON position to begin the application. Continue spraying until the correct amount of formulation has been distributed. To interrupt spraying turn power switches to the OFF position but do not close the metering valve. When spraying is finished, close meteringvalve before turning the switch to the OFF position. This will clear outlines and prevent chemicals from dripping from the nozzle. Prepare the disinfectant according to the requirement. Fill the tank of the fogger with the prepared disinfectant. Set the metering valve low to high according to the requirement. Switch on the main switch of the fogger and keep the fogger in the area to be fumigated for approximately 15 to 20 minutes Maintenance Procedure: Periodically clean the formulation tank using a hot water/ detergent solution. Fully open the machine valve and operate the machine for 3 to 5minutes, flushing the solution through the valve, lines, and nozzle After 500 hours of operation, carefully remove the blower assembly and examine the brushes and the Commutator of the Blower motor. The brushes are worn or damaged, replace the brushes. If it becomes necessary to disassemble the foundation-metering valve of cleaning, be careful not to enlarge the metering orifice or damage the taper of the valve stem. Doing so will affect the calibration of the machine. After every use remove and clean the air intake filter on the rear of the blower housing using a hot water/ detergent solution. Allow the filter to dry completely before attempting to operate the machine.

Going with a good-quality, rust- resistant brass and/or stainless steel nozzle will save you tons of frustration and repair/replacement money in the long run. Plastic nozzles are cheaper, but metal is a much more prudent choice. Types of Mist Propagation Nozzles: Two basic types of nozzles are used in mist propagation systems: 1. Oil-burner nozzles, which have a whirling action. 2. Deflection nozzles, which employ a small stream of water impacting against a small, flat plate. Compression Fittings: Compression fittings are sturdier pieces that connect your water-brining hose to water-misting nozzles. They come as T, elbow, and other shapes, to fit your needs. The compression fittings directly connect your nozzles and your irrigation tubing, so check and double-check that the tube diameter and threading sizes match before you purchase these parts! Tube or Hose: The water-carrying tube is the most easy-to-use and economical part of the mister system. Choose a ¼-inch or ½-inch delivery tube depending on your needs and the size of your compression fittings. Filter: Mesh filter to the spigot that feeds your mister system is mandatory. Operation of Greenhouse Misting System Ventilation First: It‘s essential that you already have a proper circulation/ventilation set-up in your greenhouse. Without sufficient circulation, a misting system won‘t work. While a misting system will Protected Cultivation enhance ventilation, by encouraging air to move around as temperatures vary and preventing air stratification and shading, a mister does not replace vents and fans. Watch Water: Misting nozzles vary according to the volume of water they spray. Many nozzles are adjustable. Nose nozzle can be tighten or loosen it to change how much water comes out. The tighter the nozzle, the more ―misty‖ the water, and the less volume of water being released. Placement: Misting placement differs for general greenhouse climate control and baby plant propagation. For maintaining overall greenhouse temps and humidity, you should install a misting system at the highest point in the house. For starting seeds or cutting, place the misting system directly above the flats or containers. Position them at least 2-3 feet above the plants. This will likely mean you need to build a mounting structure on which to position the misting system (since the roof frame beams of the house will be much too high). Nozzle Position: The nozzle should be spaced so that there are no dry areas on the bed and so the overlap is minimal. If excessive overlap occurs, excessive wetting may result. Most nozzle manufacturers recommend the nozzle spacing which they feel provides the best results. The most common recommended spacing is 3 to 4 feet. Be sure to follow the particular manufacturer‘s advice. Nozzles are normally placed about 18 inches above the plant-bed surface. Some manufacturers may, however, recommend lower heights. Controls for Misting Systems: Most mist propagation systems are controlled with two time clocks. The first is a 24-hour clock which turns the system on during the daylight hours and off at night. The second is a cycle timer which controls the duration of the ―on‖ cycle and the interval between mist cycles. The clock should allow both of these intervals to be adjusted to correspond to the growing and environmental requirements. During bright, warm, summer days in Oklahoma, the optimum number of mist cycles can be as many as 20 per hour. Each ―on‖ period should be as short as possible but long enough to fully wet all leaf surfaces. Fig.11.1. Layout for typical mist bench Protected Cultivation Protected Cultivation References 1. D. K.

Coverings can have a variety of additives which are used to give plastic films useful properties. For example, films may be used to exclude ultra violet (UV) light for chemical free pest control or reflect long wave infra red (IR) radiation to improve heat retention at night. As a result, some plastic covering materials are coloured or tinted. Additives to the plastic determine its:- •durability •capacity to reduce heat loss •capacity to reduce droplet formation •transmission of particular wavelengths of light •capacity to reduce the amount of dust sticking to the film. . Thermal net can increase the temperature below the net by up to 3°C compared to external field temperature . In trials it has proven to offer protection against larger insects including cabbage root fly and also protects from birds, rabbits and deer . Thermal net gives protection from wind, hail, heavy rain and helps prevent capping .Easy to use just like normal insect net and has high resistance to tearing Made out of HDPE with UVI inhibitor that can last up to 5 years .Whilst it does not offer the same level of protection as our normal insect netting it still has a niche in the market for certain early crops. Shade net or Thermal net Additives which can be used - UV (290-400 nm) absorbers and stabilisers increase durability, reduce the potential damage to biological systems in the greenhouse and may control some plant Pathogens. Infrared (700-2500 nm) absorbers reduce long wave radiation and minimise heat loss. Long wave radiation (2500-40000 nm) absorbers reduce the loss of heat radiated from materials and objects (including plants) inside the greenhouse Light diffusers scatter light entering the greenhouse, reducing the risk of plants getting burnt and improving the amount of light available to the lower parts of the plant Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water, dispersing condensation Antistatic agents reduce the tendency of dust to accumulate on plastic films. Factors influencing microclimate inside greenhouse The most important climatic factors influencing the structural design and the quality of the indoor microclimate are the temperature, the global solar radiation, the precipitation and the wind intensity. Thus, local meteorological conditions strongly influence not only the indoor climate control equipment of greenhouses but also their structural design. Harsh weather conditions are the most common cause of failure of greenhouse structures.  Light .Most important component of greenhouse . Although sunlight is the most common source; use of artificial light can be found in high end greenhouses. . 1/3rd to 1/4th part of light in full saturation is used by plants thus shading does not influences photosynthesis but reduced temperature helps on other hand. Climate control inside greenhouse The main reason for microclimate control in greenhouses is to achieve maximum plant growth and yield. Automatic control system monitors: inside the greenhouse (soil and air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentrations, electrical conductivity and soil moisture) outside the greenhouse (temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, wind direction and rainfall rate) equipment (pipe temperature, vents and curtains position) Climate in the greenhouse is controlled by: heating system ventilation and fogging system lighting and shading system fertigation system CO2 injection system Heating system in greenhouse Heating water system could be based upon the perimetric pipelines, under benches, or by overhead fan radiators A hot water heating system is the best way of provide uniform temperature distribution in the greenhouse. The hot water heating system includes:- boiler with a burner main heating loop secondary heating loops Ventilation and fogging system Greenhouse ventilation is most important for controlling the temperature, relative humidity and CO2 level. A good ventilation in the greenhouse can be achieved with a combination of a roof vent, front doors and fans. Plants grow under the influence of the PAR radiation (diurnal conditions), performing the photosynthesis process. Furthermore, temperature influences the speed of sugar production by photosynthesis, and thus radiation and temperature have to be in balance in the way that a higher radiation level corresponds to a higher temperature  Sensor and processor based systems automatically opens butterfly vents as per the Climatic requirement.

Ventilation and fogging system Lighting and shading system The lighting system Light intensity significantly influences other climate parameters in the greenhouse. Artificial illumination is applied in the absence of natural light, or when overshaded. The shading system is installed mostly to prevent heat transfer from excessive light (blocking the direct sun rays). Shade curtains also help to reduce thermal losses at night. If the weather station detects high solar radiation, the PLC activates the electric motors (roll-up system) and curtains move horizontally  T o achieve a rational use of water and fertilizer it’s best to use a fertigation system (drip irrigation), which involves the pumps, filters, control panel, EC and pH sensor. This system provides the required mixture based on current needs of the crops. The EC sensor measures water conductivity and checks the concentration of respective mixture components. Irrigation and nutrition system CO2 is added to the room to improve the process of photosynthesis. A special fan pushes CO2 from the vent, forcing it to mix with outside air in order to cool down (from 200 °C), to the ambient temperature or below it (30 °C) Gas condenser, collects the steam in the gas pipeline and separates it. A certain portion of the condensing heat can additionally warm up the soil. CO2 injection system Alternatives of soil based cultivation The Soils inside the greenhouse is subjected to frequent change due to degradation of fertility, soil borne pathogen etc. As a result, soil less cultivation is becoming popular day by day. Media for soil less cultivation can be either solid (made up of tree bark, rockwool, peat, pearlite, vermiculite wood chips etc.) or close circuit liquid media otherwise known as “hydrophonics”. Hydroponic and aeroponics are the latest addition to this. In hydroponics an inert material saturated with nutrients is used of simply nutrient dissolved in water is used.

Reddy* *Deputy General Manager, NABARD, NBSC, Lucknow 1. Types of Protected Cultivation Green House Green houses are climate controlled with cooling and heating system and mainly used growing exotic varieties of vegetables, off-season growing of vegetables, fl oriculture, planting material acclimatization and plant breeding and varietals improvement under adverse agro climatic conditions. The degree of sophistication of greenhouses include fully automated systems with poly carbonate sheet roofi ng (double walled), heating and cooling system and full scale computerized with combination of various other components. Poly House Poly house is less sophisticated version of green house with naturally ventilated climate controlled as against the fully climate controlled green houses. Usage of poly houses are similar to green houses for growing exotic varieties of vegetables, off season vegetables, fl oriculture, planting material acclimatization, etc., under ideal agro climatic conditions suitable for growing these crops. Poly Tunnel Poly tunnels are basically naturally ventilated climate controlled. Poly tunnels have a variety of applications, the majority being, growing of vegetables, fl oriculture, planting material acclimatization, Poly tunnels are built of a pre-galvanized tubular structure and mainly uses in hilly and temperate regions with moderate temperature. Shade Net House Net houses are basically naturally ventilated climate controlled strcuture. Net houses have a variety of applications, the majority being, growing of vegetables, fl oriculture and for nurseries. Net houses are built of a pre-galvanized channel cum tubular structure/ tubular structure, wooden or bamboo structures mainly used in regions with less rainfall. Hydroponics Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using water enriched with balance mineral nutrients essential for plant growth and yield. The nutrients and PH level are maintained suiting to the selected crop for better growth. Hydroponics is proved to have several advantages over soil media such as: • Suitable for vertical farming under greenhouse conditions other modifi ed structures • Effi cient use of plant nutrients without any fi xation or leaching like in soil culture • Maintains right PH , Oxygen levels for improved growth and productivity • Less incidence of pest and diseases, especially non incidence of soil borne diseases Aeroponics Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium. Aeroponics is proved to have several advantages over soil based gardening and hydroponics: • As aeroponics is conducted in air combined with micro-droplets of water helps in faster and better growth of plants with a plentiful supply of oxygen, water and nutrients • Plants in a true aeroponic conditions have 100% access to the CO2 concentrations for photosynthesis • Aeroponics can limit disease transmission since plant-to-plant contact is reduced and each spray pulse can be sterile. In the case of soil, aggregate, or other media, disease can spread throughout the growth 2. Components of Protected Cultivation Structures Depending upon the type of covering structure like green house, poly house, poly tunnels and shade net and type of crops proposed for growing and the level of control of atmosphere required, the commponets varies from strcuture to strcuture and location to location. The broad list of components of the protectecded strcutures and advantages of protected cultivation technolgies are given below: Issue : XX March - April 2017 Protected cultivation practices can be defi ned as a cropping technique wherein the micro environment surrounding the plant body is controlled partially/ fully as per plant need during their period of growth to maximize the yield and resource saving. The different type of structures and technologies are used in commercial protected cultivation. The level and type of adoption of technology depends upon location, type of crops grown, type of market targeted and quality of production required. Various types of structures and technologies adopted for commercial protected cultivation are given in this issue. Department of Economic Analysis and Research 2 In northern India and regions with extreme weather conditions like severe winter and summer, the commercial crop production is limited to 7 to 8 months. To cultivate crops in all 12 months there is need for controlled greenhouses /poly houses with heating system or pad and fan system will be added cost and the capital investment will be about 20 to 25 % more as compare to southern region. • Advanatges of techncolgy • Off season production • Production exotic varieties with high quality standards • Yield is 5 - 15 times more than open cultivation • Less chances of disease attack, thus reduction in disease control cost • Higher Efficiency of Water & Fertilizer Use • Cultivation in problematic topography, soil conditions and climate conditions • Can be fully automated requiring very less labor and manual intervention • Green House/ Poly House Components • Pre galvanised Iron / wooden", "meta": {"title": "Protected Cultivation of Horticultural Crops", "org": "NABARD", "year": "2020", "file": "“Protected Cultivation of Horticultural Crops” — National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) publication.pdf", "lang": "en"}}

Growth of Protected Cultivation The commercial protected cultivation was first introduced to the country in 1990s for establishing 100% export oriented units for Rose cultivation. The first few projects were set up in Bangaluru and Pune regions as these centers were found to be ideal with suitable agro climatic conditions and proximity to airports for quick exports. Most of the projects came up with collaboration from companies from Netherland and Israel having expertise in building and managing ploy houses. Entire poly house structures and plant materials were imported from these countries and with O&M contract for first one year or more. At that time, unit size of 4 ha with all production and captive post- harvest management infrastructure like pre cooling, grading and packaging, cold room and refrivans etc., was considered to be viable unit size. Average cost was about Rs. 200 to Rs. 250 lakh per hectare of poly house. Majority of the unit came up during initial period suffered losses due to following reasons: • Very high cost of project due to 100% import technology and components • Focus on only Rose production, lack of diversification • Gaps in production technology and quality • Lack skilled manpower • Lack of adequate cold chain infrastructure • Poor air connectivity to importing countries and higher air fright • Import restriction from EU countries with additional import duty on Indian flowers • Lack of domestic market for high priced cut flowers With initial experience gained from imported technology, many companies started promoting indigenous technologies substituting the imported components of poly houses and also standardizing technology of low cost poly houses and poly tunnels and shade nets, etc. Along with technologies, the crops cultivated under poly house got diversified with commercial cultivation of varieties of flowers, vegetables, herbs, etc. The expansion of protected cultivation further boosted by introduction of capital subsidy under schemes of National Horticulture Boards, National Horticulture Mission, Mission Integrated Development of Horticulture, etc. The major factors responsible for high growth under protected cultivation are as under: • Reduced cost of poly houses and viability of smaller size poly houses • Development of low cost poly houses and other structures • Growing domestic market for exotic vegetable and cut flowers • Attractive enterprise for new generation farmers and entrepreneurs with high returns per unit area. • Availability technical /skilled manpower for construction and management of poly houses • Capital subsidy schemes of GOI and State Governments There is no authentic data on the total area under protected cultivation. However different sources indicate that about 40000 ha is under commercial protected cultivation.

Issues in Protected Cultivation The protected cultivation technology is wide spread across the country. The commercial viability and sustainability of the technology is limited to few clusters in traditional states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. The issues and suggestions for sustainable growth of protected cultivation technology are as under: • High capital investment o The present cost of investment is unsustainable without capital subsidy support from Government o There is need for developing low cost poly house designs suitable for various agro climatic zones. • High cost of planting material o 100% planting material of the poly house varieties are imported and cost of seeds and planting materials is very high o Need for developing domestic varieties matching with the productivity and quality of imported seeds • Lack of diversifi cation o There is monopoly of few crops like colored Capsicum, Gerbera, Carnation, Rose etc., o There is a need for promoting more crops Product Major market Competitiveness Rose Export With the growing domestic consumption the price realization in the domestic market is very close to export prices. Many small units are now focusing on domestic market. The large volumes are exported on valentine and new year days. Gerbera Domestic Not economical to export due to un competitive price and fright rates Carnation Domestic Not economical to export due to un competitive price and fright rates Orchids and Anthurium Domestic International prices are less than the domestic prices Colored Capsicum Mainly domestic. Small exports to Gulf and Asian Countries Growing domestic market. Less competitive export market in terms of quality and price Other vege- tables Domestic Growing domestic market. Less competitive export market in terms of quality and price under protected cultivation for sustainability of protected cultivation • Lack of institutional arrangement o There is no dedicated institutional arrangement for R&D, planning and promoting protected cultivation and for providing backward and forward linkages • Lack of markets information o Market for produce from protected cultivation is highly fragmented and privately operated by very few aggregators.
